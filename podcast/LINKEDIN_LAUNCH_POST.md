🌾 **Introducing PANCAKE: The Operating System for Agricultural Intelligence** 🥞

After months of development, I'm thrilled to launch a comprehensive podcast series exploring PANCAKE—the world's first AI-native, spatio-temporal database platform for agriculture. Think "Linux for farm data."

**What is PANCAKE?**
PANCAKE is an open-source infrastructure project under AgStack (The Linux Foundation) that democratizes agricultural data through vendor-agnostic, AI-powered intelligence. It solves the $1B/year problem of redundant vendor integrations and data fragmentation that plagues the agricultural technology industry.

**The Podcast Series**
Over the next 10 days, I'll release one deep-dive episode daily, covering:
- Core platform architecture (PostgreSQL reimagined for agriculture)
- Universal data formats (BITE, SIP, MEAL)
- Vendor integration framework (TAP adapters)
- Multi-pronged AI queries (semantic + spatial + temporal)
- Real-world use cases (EUDR compliance, farm management, IoT sensors)
- Governance & community (AgStack open-source model)

**🎧 Episode 0: The Operating System for Agricultural Intelligence**
Today's launch episode tells the story through three personas:
- **José's Cooperative** (Colombia): 50 coffee farmers, EUDR compliance, data sovereignty
- **Sarah's Enterprise** (Iowa): 10,000 acres, vendor lock-in, ROI analysis
- **Dev's Startup** (Bangalore): Pest monitoring app, 6 months → 2 weeks to market

**Why This Matters**
The agricultural industry spends $500M-$1B annually on redundant data integrations. PANCAKE eliminates this waste by providing a universal "docking port" for vendor data—similar to how USB-C standardized device charging. One adapter, infinite possibilities.

**The Journey**
This series culminates at the **AgStack Summit on November 21 in Maastricht, The Netherlands**, where we'll showcase live demos, real farm deployments, and community contributions.

**Your Feedback Matters**
As we build PANCAKE together, I'd love to hear your thoughts:
- What resonates with your experience in ag tech?
- What questions do you have about implementation?
- What use cases should we prioritize?
- How can PANCAKE help your organization?

**[PLACEHOLDER FOR FEEDBACK]**
