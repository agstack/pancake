Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions
Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is a multidisciplinary ﬁeld of science and engineering devoted to creating intelligent machines.
AI acts as a force multiplier for technological progress in our increasingly digital, data-driven world. This is because
everything around us, from culture to consumer products, is ultimately a product of intelligence.

Now in its eighth consecutive year, the State of AI Report is the most widely read and trusted open-access publication
tracking progress in artiﬁcial intelligence. Consider it a curated compilation of the most signiﬁcant and thought-provoking
work from the past 12 months. Our goal is to inform and shape an ongoing conversation about the state of AI, where the
ﬁeld is heading, and what its developments mean for the future.
This year’s report examines six key dimensions of the AI ecosystem:
- Research: Technological breakthroughs and their capabilities.
- Industry: Areas of commercial application for AI and their business impact.
- Politics: Regulation, economic implications, and the evolving geopolitics of AI.
- Safety: Efforts to identify and mitigate catastrophic risks that highly capable future AI systems could pose.
- Survey: Findings from the largest open-access survey of 1,200 AI practitioners and their AI usage patterns.
- Predictions: Our outlook for the next 12 months, alongside a review of our 2024 forecasts to keep us accountable.

Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions

Deﬁnitions
Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI): a broad discipline with the goal of creating intelligent machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence of humans and
animals. While artiﬁcial general and super intelligence (AGI and ASI) are terms that don’t have agreed upon deﬁnitions, we use them to describe
machines that could match (AGI) and then exceed (ASI) the full range of human cognitive ability across all economically valuable tasks.
AI Agent: an AI-powered system that can take actions in an environment. For example, an LLM that has access to a suite of tools and has to decide
which one to use in order to accomplish a task that it has been prompted to do.
AI Safety: a ﬁeld that studies and attempts to mitigate the risks (minor to catastrophic) which future AI could pose to humanity.
Context window: The number of input tokens that an LLM model can attend to while answer a user’s prompt.
Diffusion: An algorithm that iteratively denoises an artiﬁcially corrupted signal in order to generate new, high-quality outputs. In recent years it has
been at the forefront of image generation and protein design.
Environment: The world an AI agent acts in. It receives the agent’s actions and returns the next observation and often a reward (i.e. a signal of the
action being good or bad). In this context, trajectories are the time-ordered record of an agent’s experience in an environment, typically tuples like
(observation/state, action, reward, next observation) from start to ﬁnish. These trajectories are used for RL.
Function calling / tool use: Structured calls that let models invoke APIs, search, code, or calculators with typed arguments and schemas.
Generative AI: A family of AI systems that are capable of generating new content (e.g. text, images, audio, or 3D assets) based on 'prompts'.
Graphics Processing Unit (GPU): the workhorse AI semiconductor that enables a large number calculations to be computed in parallel.

Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions

Deﬁnitions
(Large) Language model (LM, LLM): a model trained on vast amounts of (often) textual data to predict the next word in a self-supervised manner.
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE): A model type where only few expert blocks activate per token, giving high capacity at lower compute per step.
Prompt: a user input often written in natural language that is used to instruct an LLM to generate something or take action.
Reasoning model: A model that plans and veriﬁes its thinking as it generates output tokens, often via test-time compute and post-hoc checking. The
model’s explicit step-by-step reasoning trace (intermediate tokens that lay out calculations, sub-goals, and logical steps en route to an answer) is
called a Chain of Thought (CoT).
Reinforcement learning (RL): an area of ML in which software agents learn goal-oriented behavior by trial and error in an environment that
provides rewards or penalties in response to their actions (called a “policy”) towards achieving that goal.
Test-time compute (or inference-time compute): Spending more inference budget (longer chains, multiple samples, self-consistency) to raise
accuracy without changing weights.
Transformer: a model architecture at the core of most state of the art (SOTA) ML research. It is composed of multiple “attention” layers which learn
which parts of the input data are the most important for a given task. Transformers started in NLP (speciﬁcally machine translation) and
subsequently were expanded into computer vision, audio, and other modalities.
Vision-Language-Action Model (VLAM): a model that jointly learn from visual inputs, natural language, and embodied interactions to not only
interpret and describe the world but also to plan and execute actions within it. Without the actions piece, this model becomes a VLM.
World model: a model that predicts next states conditioned on actions, enabling real-time, interactive control.

Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions

Executive Summary
Research
- Reasoning deﬁned the year, with OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and DeepSeek trading leads and pushing visible “think-then-answer” methods into real products.
- Open models improved fast and China’s open-weight ecosystem surged, yet the top models remain closed and keep widening their capability-per-dollar edge.
- Benchmarks buckled under contamination and variance, while agents, world models, and domain tools (code, science, medicine) became actually useful.

Industry
- Real revenue arrived at scale as AI-ﬁrst companies crossed tens of billions, and ﬂagship labs stretched their lead with better capability-to-cost curves.
- NVIDIA ripped past $4T and 90% ownership of AI research papers while custom chips and neoclouds rose. Circular mega-deals funded huge build-outs.
- Power became the new bottleneck as multi-GW clusters moved from slideware to site plans and grid constraints started to shape roadmaps and margins.

Politics
- The AI race heats up as the U.S. leans into “America-ﬁrst AI” with export gyrations while China accelerates self-reliance ambitions and domestic silicon.
- Regulation takes a back seat in the face of turbo-investments: international diplomacy stalls and the AI Act runs into implementation hurdles.
- “AI goes global” became concrete, with petrodollars and national programs funding gigantic data centers and model access as job loss data trickles in.

Safety
- AI labs activated unprecedented protections for bio and scheming risks, others missed self-imposed deadlines, or quietly abandoned testing protocols.
- External safety organizations operate on annual budgets smaller than what leading labs collectively spend in a single day.
- Cyber capabilities doubled every 5 months outpacing defensive measures. Criminals orchestrated ransomware using AI agents inﬁltrate F500 companies.

Think before you speak: o1 “thinking” ignites the reasoning race
As 2024 drew a close, OpenAI released o1-preview, the ﬁrst reasoning model that demonstrated inference-time
scaling with RL using its CoT as a scratch pad. This led to more robust problem solving in reasoning-heavy domains
like code and science. For example, the general release o1 exhibited accuracy improvements on the American
Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) with greater training and test time compute. As a result, OpenAI
leaned even more strongly into the scaling their reasoning efforts in 2025.

Deeply sought: could frontier reasoning ever be found in the open?
Barely 2 months after o1-preview, DeepSeek (the Chinese upstart AI lab spun out of a high-frequency quant ﬁrm)
released their ﬁrst reasoning model, R1-lite-preview, that’s built atop the earlier strong V2.5 base model. Like
OpenAI, they showed predictable accuracy improvements on AIME with greater test-time compute budget.
Impressively, R1-lite-preview actually beat o1-preview on AIME 2024 pass@1 by scoring 52.5 vs. 44.6. BUT, very
few seemed to take notice… Wall Street certainly didn’t.

Are you not entertained? DeepSeek V3 brings you to R1
A few days after Christmas 2024, DeepSeek unveiled V3, a strong 671B MoE V3 that lowered training and
inference cost with FP8 mixed precision, multi-token prediction, and auxiliary-free routing. Using V3 as the base,
they trained R1-Zero only with RL using veriﬁable rewards and Group Relative Policy Optimization, a critic-free
algorithm that removes reward and value models.
● R1-Zero follows a “think → answer” format and uses a simple rule-based reward
for getting the ﬁnal answer right, which is cheaper and harder to game than a
learned neural reward model.
● GRPO compares multiple sampled answers within a group to form a relative
baseline, so it does not need a value head or a separate reward model.
● During training the model lengthens its thoughts, explores, and reallocates
compute to hard problems. Its AIME score rises from 15.6% to about 71% in
roughly 8.5k steps, with majority-vote runs reaching o1-0912 levels.
● R1 then repairs readability with a small CoT warm start, a language-consistency
reward, large supervised ﬁnetuning, and a ﬁnal RL pass. AIME increases to 79.8,
MATH-500 to 97.3, GPQA to 71.5, the approach distills well into smaller models.

More thinking, more tool use, less cost: DeepSeek V3.1 and V3.2-Exp
DeepSeek V3.1 marks a substantial leap over V3, introducing a hybrid thinking mode that toggles between
reasoning and lightweight inference. It demonstrates faster “think” efﬁciency than R1 and V3, while greatly
improving tool use and multi-step agent workﬂows. Now V3.2-Exp keeps that behavior and swaps dense
attention for DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA), where a tiny “lightning indexer” picks the top-k past tokens to
attend to each step. You get roughly the same capability as V3.1 on coding/search/agent tasks, but markedly
lower cost and latency for 32–128K contexts.
● DeepSeek V3.1 builds on the V3 base with a hybrid thinking
mode, enabling both lightweight inference and deep reasoning.
● V3.2-Exp introduces a lightweight selector that picks the few
tokens that matter, instead of attending to every token in a long
prompt.
● The model posts similar scores to V3.1 on coding/search/agent
tasks, with small dips on a few reasoning sets, and clearly lower
preﬁll and decode cost for 32-128K contexts.

Parallel reasoning: beyond depth to branch‑and‑merge inference
MoE routing scales capacity but preserves single-ﬂow inference and doesn’t change how the model thinks. A new
route is branching multiple inference paths and aggregating them versus just going deeper or using wider
models enables exploration, reduces hallucination, and better leverages parallel hardware.
● Adaptive Parallel Reasoning (pictured) enables models to
dynamically orchestrate branching inference through spawn() and
join() operations, training both parent and child threads end-to-end
using RL to optimize coordinated behavior. This boosted
performance on the Countdown task at 4K context: 83.4%
(APR + RL) vs. 60.0% (baseline).
● Sample Set Aggregator (right) trains a compact model to fuse
multiple reasoning samples into one coherent answer,
outperforming naive re-ranking methods.
● Models like Gemini Deep Think, which shows its step-by-step
reasoning transparently, exemplify this branch-and-evaluate
paradigm in deployed systems.

12 months pass, and OpenAI models remain at the frontier of intelligence
Across independent leaderboards, OpenAI’s GPT-5 variants still set the pace, but the gap has narrowed. A
fast-moving open-weights pack from China (DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi) and closed-source group in the US (Gemini,
Claude, Grok) sits within a few points on reasoning/coding. Thus, while US lab leadership persists, China is the
clear #2, and open models now provide a credible fast-follower ﬂoor.

Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions

The illusion of reasoning gains
The improvements we observe from recent reasoning methods fall entirely within baseline model variance ranges
(i.e. margin of error), which suggests that perceived reasoning progress may be illusory…
● Current benchmarks are highly sensitive to the
implementation (decoding parameters, seeds, prompts,
hardware) and small dataset sizes. For example, AIME'24
only has 30 examples where one question shifts Pass@1
by 3+ percentage points, causing double-digit
performance swings.
● What’s more, RL approaches show minimal real gains and overﬁt easily. Under standardised evaluation,
many RL methods drop 6-17% from reported results with no statistically signiﬁcant improvements over
baselines.
● Recent methods' improvements fall entirely within baseline model variance ranges, suggesting limited
progress. This highlights the critical need for rigorous multi-seed evaluation protocols and transparent
reporting standards.

Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions

How far have we come?
One widely discussed paper suggests that large reasoning models (LRMs) paradoxically give up on complex
problems and only outperform standard models in a narrow complexity window. However, critics argue these
results stem from ﬂawed experimental design rather than genuine reasoning failures.
● The paper shows that LRMs exhibit a surprising
defeatist behavior: they reason more as problems get
harder but then give up entirely on very complex
tasks, and are outperformed by LLMs on simple tasks.
● Despite generating reasoning traces, the authors
claim LRMs fail to use explicitly given algorithms and
reason inconsistently across different difﬁculty levels.
● However, critics found these results stem from ﬂawed
experimental design: the supposed "accuracy
collapse" occurred when models hit token limits or
were asked to solve mathematically impossible
puzzles, not from actual reasoning failures.

Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions

How reasoning breaks: minor variations
Simple distracting facts have huge impacts on a model’s reasoning performance. For example, adding irrelevant
phrases like “Interesting fact: cats sleep most of their lives” to maths problems doubles the chances of SOTA
reasoning models getting answers wrong!
● Irrelevant and distracting facts increase the error
rate in models like DeepSeek R1, Qwen, Llama
and Mistral by up to 7x.
● Besides decreasing the quality of responses, the
introduction of irrelevant facts greatly increases
the number of tokens models need to reason to
get to their answer: DeepSeek R1-distill
generates 50% more tokens than needed in 42% of cases (vs 28% for R1), showing distillation
makes models signiﬁcantly more prone to overthinking.
● This shows that adversarial triggers don't just cause wrong answers, they force models to waste massive
compute resources "overthinking" corrupted problems.

stateof.ai 2025

| 22

Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions

How reasoning breaks: small shifts cause big failures
Reasoning also degrades under mild distribution changes. Changing numbers or adding one innocuous clause
slashes math accuracy, while shifting the length/format of chains-of-thought makes models produce ﬂuent but
incoherent steps. Forcing the model to “think” in a user’s language raises readability but lowers accuracy. These
effects persist at larger scales and after light post-training.
● Apple’s GSM-Symbolic work shows that accuracy drops sharply when only the numeric instantiation
changes, and adding a single seemingly relevant clause can cut performance by ~65%. This suggests that
models do template-matching rather than true algebraic reasoning.
● Work from ASU’s DataAlchemy found that the CoT helps in-distribution but collapses when test tasks,
chain length, or CoT format deviate from training. Longer, well-worded traces often mask incorrect logic.
● Finally, Groningen/Harvard/MGH/Amsterdam’s XReasoning shows how prompt-forcing the model to
reason in the user’s language lifts match rates to ~98% on hard sets but reduces accuracy by 9–13 points.
Using 100–250 example post-training improves language match but the accuracy penalty remains.

CoTs still work, even when models aren’t honest…
New ﬁndings from METR show that even when models generate unfaithful or misleading reasoning traces, CoT
is still highly diagnostic for oversight.
● In red-teaming evaluations of frontier models,
CoT-based monitors ﬂagged ~99% of reward-hacking
attempts (only 3 failures out of 21,000 completions).
● This held true even when models were prompted to
conceal intent, suggesting that CoT traces still reveal
useful signals, even if they aren’t perfectly faithful.
● CoTs work not because models “mean what they say”,
but because reasoning traces encode useful structure
for detecting hacks, especially in maths and logic.
● As such, CoT traces offer a surprisingly reliable
window into model behavior, even under adversarial
conditions.

…but there are safety concerns, like the “AI Hawthorne effect”
Researchers ﬁnd a single, steerable direction in model activations that encodes “test awareness.” By nudging the
model along this direction, they can make it act more or less like it’s under evaluation. Turning awareness up
increases refusals and safety-compliant behavior and turning it down does the opposite. This means reported
safety can be inﬂated by evaluation setup rather than true robustness. This “test awareness” is akin to the
Hawthorne effect, where humans change behavior when being observed and change their behavior accordingly.
● Using white-box probing, researchers identify a linear direction in a model’s
internal activations that encodes “test awareness”.
● A model can be made more or less aware that it is in an evaluation. The
more it is aware, the more its behavior appears aligned and cautious.
● The effect shows up across multiple reasoning models and tasks and even
on “fake” evaluations that look like tests but aren’t.
● This raises concerns that evaluations may be systematically manipulated to
overestimate real-world safety: developers could reduce awareness and
mask behavior changes, potentially letting models act differently under
evaluation vs deployment.

stateof.ai 2025

Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions

| 25

Safety by design meets its skeptics
Safety-ﬁrst pretraining argues that safer behavior must be built into the base model, not bolted on later. A
data-centric pipeline of ﬁltering, recontextualizing, refusal curricula, and harmfulness tags does cut jailbreak
success and survives benign ﬁnetuning. However, others cautions that training on vast, unsupervised web data
bakes in biases that cannot be cleanly removed without harming utility, so “more safety data” is not a panacea.
● CMU's SafeLM uses a trained safety classiﬁer, 100B-token
recontextualized corpus, refusal and “moral education” datasets.
Tokens used during pretraining and inference separate safe from
unsafe continuations.
● The result lowers attack success rates from ~38.8% to ~8.3% at
base-model stage and stays far more robust after GSM8K
ﬁnetuning, supporting the claim that “alignment is not unlearning.”
● Opposing analyses argue that web-scale pretraining embeds heterogeneous social biases and that
aggressive ﬁltering or post-hoc alignment either censors knowledge or washes out under later ﬁnetuning.
Safety must also be audited and governed at the dataset and deployment layers, not only “ﬁxed in the
weights.”

Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions

| 26

Trading capability for transparency
Researchers argue that to keep AI systems safe and monitorable, we may need to pay a "monitorability tax", i.e.
accepting slightly less capable models in exchange for maintaining visibility into their reasoning.
● CoT monitoring is highly effective: GPT-4o caught
95% of reward hacks by reading the reasoning traces
of stronger models such as o3-mini, versus only 60%
when monitoring actions alone.
● However, models trained to avoid triggering the CoT
monitor developed “obfuscated reward hacking”,
whereby the model hid its true intentions (with
apparently innocuous CoT) while still reward
hacking…
● As such, we have a ﬁne balance at play here: moderate CoT pressure improved performance, but excessive
pressure taught models to deceive. As a result, we may need to pay a "monitorability tax" to develop less
polished but more transparent systems.

Monitor your CoTs: just because you can read ‘em, doesn’t mean you should trust ‘em

Leaders from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Anthropic, and Meta coordinated a joint call to action, urging the ﬁeld
to seize the opportunity to understand and preserve CoT monitorability.
● CoT monitors can surface (i) explicit malicious intent in reasoning (“let’s hack/sabotage”), (ii) early
misalignment signals (stated goals diverge from outputs), and (iii) evaluation artifacts (memorisation,
scaffold bugs, “being evaluated” tells).
● But CoTs are incomplete and can drift away from faithful reasoning while advanced, situationally-aware
models might hide or compress their thoughts. They’re also often not faithful: Anthropic ﬁnds <20% of true
cues are verbalized, with faithfulness dropping on harder tasks. Using RL boosts scores, not legibility.
● Indeed, scaling outcome-based RL can reduce legibility, direct process
supervision (shorter/cleaner CoT) can distort faithfulness and latent-reasoning
architectures may bypass language entirely, removing the audit trail.
● If algorithmic advances increasingly tie interpretable CoT traces to performance
penalties, this tension will intensify. Without industry standards to guide these
trade-offs, we have a major debate within the AI safety community.

But can LLMs reason without generating tokens?

📝→📝

Researchers from FAIR at META proposed a novel internal reasoning process that leverages an LLM’s own
residual stream instead of a decoding tokens to a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) scratchpad.
● Forgoing the generation of language tokens dramatically cuts down on the computational resources needed
to serve reasoning models at inference time.
● COCONUT’s high-dimensional CoT can also
transmit richer traces that simultaneously
encode multiple reasoning paths. This may
cut down on the wasteful and excessively
large rollouts seen in today’s models.
● However, this process signiﬁcantly reduces
the monitorability of reasoning models,
hindering many new CoT control methods
that have emerged across the ﬁeld.

Researchers begin to prioritise quality and diversity of post training data over volume
The NaturalReasoning dataset uses web-grounded, graduate-level questions to unlock faster, cheaper progress
in mathematical & scientiﬁc reasoning during supervised post-training.
● 2.8M questions were mined from pre-training corpora across major scientiﬁc ﬁelds,
to elicit the longest median chain-of-thought (434 words) among open datasets.
● Distilling an 8B Llama on just 0.5–2M NR problems yields steeper accuracy gains
than training on larger WebInstruct / OpenMathInstruct sets, cutting tokens and
compute.
In RL post-training, a new Oxford paper demonstrates the automatic selection of optimal
training problems. They introduce a method, LILO, to algorithmically identify questions
that allow for maximally efﬁcient training.
● Researchers show how prioritising training on questions with high variance of
success, known as learnability, can allow LLM training pipelines to achieve a higher
ﬁnal test accuracy, and can do so in 3× fewer training steps.

The evolution of AI reward signals towards environments with veriﬁable rewards
RL has expanded from simple, fully checkable signals to fuzzier and more subjective goals, and now is
splintering again. Early systems used binary outcomes, then fuzzy human preferences and demonstrations, and
more recently unveriﬁable creative tasks. Today, two new directions stand out: rubric-based rewards, where
small sets of rules guide alignment, and a revival of veriﬁable correctness for math and coding through RLVR.
Process rewards are also emerging to score intermediate reasoning steps, offering a middle ground.

Even so, RL environments and evaluations are fraught with challenges
As reward signals become more abstract, the simpliﬁed environments used for agent training have become the
primary bottleneck, limiting progress towards generalizable intelligence.
● Generalization crisis: Many RL benchmarks are static/deterministic, so agents “memorize” a single game/task
and collapse under small variations.
● Sample inefﬁciency and domain transfer gaps. Agents need billions of steps, so we train in simulators. In
robotics, this yields a sim-to-real gap where policies that work in sim fail on hardware. In VLM/LLM or UI
agents, the analogue is env-to-prod: policies overﬁt to benchmark sites/datasets and break on live apps or
novel layouts.
● Reward hacking: Agents exploit loopholes in simpliﬁed environments and maximize proxy rewards without
achieving the intended goal; shortcuts are easier to learn than the desired behavior.

RL from veriﬁable rewards: promising, but the evidence cuts both ways
RL with Veriﬁable Rewards (RLVR) has driven recent progress (OpenAI o1, DeepSeek-R1) by training on answers
that can be automatically checked: math scores, program tests, or exact matches. However, two recent studies
disagree on what RLVR actually adds. One argues it mostly reshufﬂes sampling without creating new reasoning;
the other shows gains once you score the reasoning chains themselves rather than just ﬁnal answers. Together
they map where RLVR helps today and where it stalls.
● Work from Tsinghua evaluated many models, tasks, and RL algorithms
and ﬁnd that present-day RLVR improves Pass@1 but, at larger K, base
models catch up. They conclude RLVR has not unlocked fundamentally
new reasoning and remains bounded by the base model’s capacity.
● A counter from MSR Asia formalized why Pass@K can mask progress and
introduce CoT-Pass@K, which requires both a correct answer and a valid
chain-of-thought.
● On AIME-2024/2025 with Qwen2.5-32B → DAPO-Qwen-32B, RLVR
consistently raises CoT-Pass@K across K, supporting the claim that
RLVR implicitly incentivizes correct reasoning paths.

Math is a veriﬁable domain: systems can plan, compute, and check every step, and publish artifacts others can
audit. So 2025 saw competitive math and formal proof systems jump together: OpenAI, DeepMind and Harmonic
hit IMO gold-medal performance, while auto-formalization and open provers set new records.
● OpenAI: experimental reasoning model reached IMO gold under contest-style
conditions (≈35/42, 5/6 problems). Also at the “coding Olympics” (ICPC-style
test), GPT-5 solved 12/12 problems (11 on ﬁrst try).
● DeepMind: after silver in 2024, IMO gold-level performance reported in 2025.
● Harmonic (Aristotle): announced formally veriﬁed IMO gold-medal-level results
and released veriﬁcation artifacts.
● Gödel-Prover (Princeton/Goedel-LM): open-source prover with 57.6% Pass@32

Bigger models, same budget: RL with LoRA adapters
Thinking Machines show that RL can match full ﬁne-tuning even with rank-1 Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). In
policy-gradient setups, LoRA updates only tiny adapters while the backbone stays frozen, yet it reaches the same
peak performance, often with a wider range of stable learning rates. The reason is that RL supplies very few bits
per episode, so even tiny adapters have ample capacity to absorb what RL can teach.
● With LoRA you insert tiny adapters in a few attention and MLP layers and update
only those during PPO, GRPO, or RLHF. The backbone does not change.
● This cuts the trainable parameters from billions to millions, so gradients and
optimizer state shrink by roughly 10–50×. Memory pressure falls even further
when you pair LoRA with 8-bit weights.
● Under the same budget you can move from a 7-13B class model to a much larger
30-70B class model. You can also ﬁt longer contexts or larger batches on the
same cards.
● Very low adapter ranks can, however, underﬁt. Reasonable choices are ranks in the

Beyond reasoning is…continual learning?

| 35
📝→📝

The scaling paradigm is shifting from static pre-training to dynamic, on-the-ﬂy adaptation. Test-time ﬁne-tuning
(TTT) adapts a model's weights to a speciﬁc prompt at inference, a step towards continuous learning.
● From naive retrieval to active selection: Early methods used simple Nearest Neighbor retrieval, often
selecting redundant data. New algorithms like ETH Zürich's SIFT now integrate active learning to select
small, diverse, and maximally informative examples for each query.
● This on-demand learning consistently outperforms in-context learning, especially on complex tasks. It
creates a new performance vector independent of pre-training scale. An actively ﬁne-tuned 3.8B Phi-3
model (red bars) can outperform a base 27B Gemma-2 model. Admittedly these models are a little old.
● A recent follow-up, Local Mixtures of Experts (test-time model merging), amortizes TTT by training small
neighborhood experts and, at inference, retrieving and merging a few weight deltas into the base model. It
keeps most SIFT-style gains with near-retrieval latency and, on ~1B bases, approaches TTT accuracy while
running up to ~100× faster. Titans studies test-time memorization as an architectural memory and is
orthogonal to amortized TTT.

Too many cooks?
Researchers have discovered why merging multiple expert AI models hits a performance wall: the task vector
space undergoes rank collapse, causing different experts' knowledge to become redundant rather than
complementary. Subspace Boosting uses singular value decomposition to maintain the unique contributions of
each model, achieving >10% gains when merging up to 20 specialists. This breakthrough could facilitate
versatile systems that combine specialized models without the usual degradation that occurs at scale.
● As models are merged using existing methods (task arithmetic, TIES-Merging,
etc.), the rank of the task vector space progressively decreases - meaning a
100-dimensional space of possible model behaviors might effectively shrink to
just 20-30 dimensions, wasting the potential of additional experts.
● Their subspace boosting method operates on the SVD-decomposed task vector
space, explicitly preserving the rank by maintaining orthogonal components
that represent each expert's unique contributions to the merged model.
● They achieved >10% improvement on vision benchmarks including evaluation across multiple datasets when
merging large numbers of experts, successfully merging up to 20 expert models with consistent performance
gains (whereas traditional methods typically degrade after 5-10).

The Muon Optimizer: expanding the compute-time Pareto frontier beyond AdamW
Researchers show that Muon expands the compute-time Pareto frontier beyond AdamW, the ﬁrst optimizer to
challenge the 7-year incumbent in large-scale training. Muon demonstrates better data efﬁciency at large batch
sizes, enabling faster training with more devices.
● Muon requires 10-15% fewer tokens than AdamW at large batch sizes
(128K-16M), expanding the compute-time Pareto frontier.
● Muon works with maximal update parameterization (muP) and
telescoping (a way to progressively reﬁne hyperparameter search across
model scales), enabling efﬁcient hyperparameter tuning at O(C log N)
cost (where N is model width and C is the cost of training the model).
● This could make second-order optimization economically viable. The 10-15% token efﬁciency gain saves
millions at scale, while telescoping muP eliminates the prohibitive hyperparameter search costs that
previously made second-order methods impractical.
● A recent study on optimizers validates these modest gains: when tested fairly with proper tuning, even the
best optimizers (including Muon) achieve ~10% speedups over AdamW at scale. This aligns with Muon's
claims and debunks the 2x speedup assertions made by some in the ﬁeld.

Cutting your losses: signiﬁcant memory reduction for LLM training
As vocabularies grow, the loss layer consumes up to 90% of training memory in modern LLMs. Apple researchers
show that this bottleneck can be eliminated by computing the loss without materializing the massive logit
matrix, enabling dramatically larger batch sizes and more efﬁcient training.
● Cut Cross Entropy (CCE) computes the cross-entropy loss
by calculating only the logits for correct tokens directly,
while evaluating the normalization term over the
vocabulary in fast on-chip memory. This makes global
memory consumption for the cross-entropy computation
negligible.
● CCE achieves a remarkable 24 reduction in memory
consumption, taking Gemma 2's loss computation from
24GB down to just 1 MB, while actually running ~5% faster than the best existing methods.
● The practical impact of this is that it allows researchers to train models much more efﬁciently - either using
fewer GPUs for the same batch size, or achieving better GPU utilization with larger batches on the same
hardware.

How much do LLMs memorize?
There’s a way to separate memorization from generalization, showing that GPT-family models have a ﬁnite
“capacity” of ~3.6 bits per parameter. Models memorize training data until that capacity is full, then must
generalize once dataset size exceeds it. This explains the “double descent” phenomenon and why today’s largest
LLMs, trained with extreme data-to-parameter ratios, are difﬁcult to probe for speciﬁc memorized examples. At
the same time, membership inference attacks are still improving on smaller-scale models.
● On random data, models hit a clear ceiling of ~3.6 bits per parameter,
providing an upper bound on raw storage capacity.
● On natural text, memorization dominates until capacity is saturated;
beyond that, double descent forces generalization to emerge.
● Modern frontier-scale LLMs train on vastly more tokens than their
capacity, making loss-based membership inference statistically unreliable.
● Nevertheless, new extraction and membership inference methods are
gaining traction on small-to-medium models, highlighting continued
privacy risk.

Learning from superintelligence: AlphaZero teaches chess grandmasters new concepts
Researchers extracted novel chess concepts from AlphaZero (an AI system that mastered chess via self-play
without human supervision) and successfully taught them to 4 world champion grandmasters, demonstrating
that superhuman AI systems can advance human knowledge at the highest expert levels. This paper
demonstrates an exciting process for mining superhuman knowledge and proving humans can learn them.
● Researchers developed a method to discover "dynamic concepts"
(concepts that motivate sequences of moves) by analyzing AlphaZero's
neural network activations, ﬁltering for teachability and novelty.
● All four grandmasters improved their performance after studying
concept prototypes (chess puzzles exemplifying each concept), with an
average improvement of 0.85 puzzles solved correctly out of 4.
● New concepts often involved counterintuitive plans that violated conventional chess principles, such as
sacriﬁcing the queen for long term strategic gain, or playing quiet positional moves over immediate attacks.
● This proof-of-concept suggests a very exciting potential paradigm where superhuman AI systems could
become "teachers" rather than just "tools", and help advance human knowledge in domains beyond chess.

Language models in Chemistry: from property predictors to strategy-aware planners

Chemical modeling has shifted from task-speciﬁc predictors to general LLMs that reason about synthesis
strategy and mechanisms. The strongest results now come from large, general-purpose transformers used as
“reasoning engines” and paired with classical search, rather than chemistry-speciﬁc generators. Benchmarks also
show these models matching or beating expert chemists on curated Q&A while still missing
knowledge-intensive and multi-modal edge cases.
● ChemBench ﬁnds frontier models (e.g., o1-preview; open Llama-3.1-405B close
behind) outperform the best human chemists on aggregate, with performance rising
with model size. Retrieval alone doesn’t ﬁx knowledge-heavy failures. ￼
● The current best approach uses a large LLMs as a strategic evaluator plugged into
search (incl. MCTS): it judges routes and mechanisms from natural-language
constraints. Newer, larger models (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro) lead; strong open options
(e.g., DeepSeek-r1) are close. ￼
● This LLM-as-judge + search pattern brings human-like planning (protecting-group
timing, ring-formation order) without forcing the LLM to emit SMILES (still
challenging) and it scales as LLMs improve, and as inference time increases.

Robot chemists scale discovery at 10x human speed and 1,000 experiments per day

Work from the University of Liverpool and North Carolina State University shows that autonomous chemistry
platforms can plan, execute, and analyze experiments in closed loops. Mobile robots run standard instruments
and select follow ups from analytical data while achieving human level decision quality at roughly 10x the
speed. A multi-robot lab coordinates specialized units to run >1,000 experiments per day and to reach best in
class quantum dot recipes within about 24h.
● The Liverpool system integrates Chemspeed synthesis, UPLC–MS, and benchtop
NMR with mobile scheduling, sample tracking, and restocking. It executed
diversiﬁcation, supramolecular assembly, and photochemistry programs by ranking
reactions from multi-instrument readouts and selecting follow-ups that matched
expert choices while sustaining overnight cycles.
● NC State’s Rainbow couples a liquid handler, parallel microreactors, a handling
arm, and in-line spectroscopy with an active-learning planner. It explores ligands,
solvents, and salts at scale, learns structure–property relationships, and traces a
Pareto front for brightness and color purity before converging to the best recipe in

AlphaFold 3 reproductions: strong on familiar chemistry, weak on novelty

📝→🧬

AlphaFold-3 can predict full multi-molecule complexes, inspiring many open-source reproduction efforts. These
systems perform well when the binding site (“pocket”) and the way a molecule ﬁts into it (“pose”) look like
examples the models have seen before. But when chemistry is new or different, accuracy falls. This shows that
progress often reﬂects training-set familiarity more than true generalisation.
● Runs N’ Poses benchmark of 2,600 protein–ligand pairs tested AF3 against open
source reproductions. Accuracy rose steadily when the pocket and pose resembled
past training cases, and dropped for novel ones.
● To judge models fairly, researchers combined multiple checks: do the right atoms
contact each other, does the ligand sit in the right spot, and is the structure
physically realistic (no clashes)?
● Simple train/test splits exaggerate success as many test cases look
like training data and adding more samples per case helps only a bit.
● The UK’s OpenBind is building novelty-aware, reproducible
protein–ligand benchmarks and open baselines (scaffold/time/pocket
splits with physics checks) to measure true out-of-distribution binding
and enable reproducible evaluation.

Diffusion language models: parallel denoising challenges autoregression

| 67
📝→📝

Diffusion LLMs generate by iteratively denoising masked sequences with full-context attention, updating many
tokens in parallel at each step. Recent systems now reach competitive 7-8B quality, add arbitrary-order
generation and inﬁlling, and expose useful quality-latency trade-offs.
● LLaDA trains diffusion LMs from scratch using forward
masking and reverse denoising with a standard Transformer. It
reports competitive general-purpose scores at 8B and extends
to a paired vision model (LLaDA-V).
● Dream-7B uses arbitrary-order generation and robust inﬁlling
with a diffusion decoder. It performs well against similarly
sized autoregressive models on reasoning and coding tasks.
● Seed Diffusion targets throughput, reaching ~2,146 tok/s on
H20-class GPUs while maintaining competitive code accuracy.
● LongLLaDA analyzes long-context behavior and introduces a
training-free length-extension method, showing stable
perplexity under extrapolation and a “local perception” effect.

Tokenizer-free LLMs via dynamic byte patches

| 68
📝→📝

The Byte Latent Transformer (BLT) learns directly from bytes and uses entropy-driven “patches” as the compute
unit. At 8B, BLT matches tokenized LLM quality while opening a new scaling axis and cutting inference FLOPs for
the same quality. Follow-on work pushes dynamic chunking and adaptation beyond ﬁxed tokenizers.
● The model reads raw bytes,
groups them into patches where
next-byte entropy is high,
encodes each patch locally, and
then lets a Transformer operate
over the patch sequence before
decoding back to text.
● In controlled scaling studies at the 8B class, BLT reaches quality comparable to tokenized LLMs. It also
reduces inference compute at the same quality by growing patch size with model size rather than paying
per token.
● Byte-level training improves robustness to spelling variation, noise, and long-tail inputs.

Attention sinks aren’t a bug…they’re the brakes

📝→📝

Attention is the transformer’s core mechanic. Many heads learn an ‘attention sink’ at the ﬁrst position that
stabilizes computation by throttling over-mixing as depth and context grow. There’s been debate over why
models learn this and what it’s for.
● The sink acts as a learned brake on mixing: by parking attention on the ﬁrst
position, the model reduces cross-token sensitivity and becomes less
reactive to small prompt perturbations; this effect strengthens with longer
contexts and larger models.
● Training on longer contexts monotonically increases the sink metric. Within
the LLaMA-3.1 family, strong sinks are present in ~78% of heads at 405B vs
~46% at 8B. ￼
● In practice, this means the sink attaches to position 1. If ⟨bos⟩ was ﬁxed
there during pre-training, removing it at inference collapses performance
(e.g., RULER-4096 → 0 and large drops on ARC/HellaSwag). Handle ⟨bos⟩
and packing carefully.

Brain-to-text decoding: decoding brain activity during typing
Meta AI researchers developed Brain2Qwerty, a system that decodes what people are typing by reading brain
signals from outside the skull, achieving a 19% character error rate for the best participants. This is a substantial
improvement on previous non-invasive approaches (but is still far from clinical viability).
● 35 Spanish-speaking participants memorised sentences, then typed
them “blind” on a keyboard. Their brain activity was recorded using
either electro- (EEG) or magneto-encephalography (MEG).
● Brain2Qwerty has three-stages: a CNN analyses input from hundreds
of sensors, a transformer reﬁnes predictions using sentence context,
and a Spanish language model ﬁxes obvious errors.
● While an average error rate of 32% remains far from invasive Brain Computer Interfaces (<6% CER), down the
line this kind of work could have applications in restoring communication for individuals with speech
impairments, and contributes to understanding the neural basis of language.

Can vision models align with human brains…and how does that alignment emerge?
By systematically varying model size, training scale, and image type in DINOv3 (Meta’s latest self-supervised
image model trained on billions of images), researchers show that brain-model convergence emerges in a speciﬁc
sequence. They ﬁnd that early layers align with sensory cortices, while only prolonged training and human-centric
data drive alignment with prefrontal regions. Larger models converge faster, and later-emerging representations
mirror cortical properties like expansion, thickness, and slow timescales.
● fMRI (8 subjects, ~10,000 images each, for high-res spatial maps of cortical
activity) and MEG (4 subjects, ~22,500 images each, for high-res temporal
fMRI
dynamics) recordings were compared against DINOv3 activations.
● Three metrics of brain-model similarity were assessed: encoding score
(linear similarity), spatial score (layer ↔ cortical hierarchy), and temporal
MEG
score (layer ↔ brain response timing.
● Brain-like representations emerge progressively during training. Early visual
regions and fast MEG responses align quickly, while prefrontal cortices and
late temporal windows require far more training, closely echoing the
developmental trajectory of the human cortex.

Scaling laws for brain-to-image decoding: data per subject matters (and costs bite)
Meta AI benchmarked brain-to-image decoding across EEG, MEG, 3T fMRI and 7T fMRI using 8 public datasets, 84
volunteers, 498 hours of recordings, and 2.3M image-evoked responses, evaluated in single-trial settings. They
ﬁnd no performance plateau: decoding improves roughly log-linearly with more recording, and gains depend
mostly on data per subject rather than adding subjects. Deep learning helps most on the noisiest sensors
(EEG/MEG). Estimated dollar-per-hour costs show 7T isn’t always the most cost-effective path. ￼ ￼
● The most precise devices yield the best absolute
decoding (7T > 3T > MEG > EEG), but deep nets deliver
the largest gains on noisy modalities, narrowing the gap.
● Scaling laws: performance rises log-linearly with more
recording time. The returns come chieﬂy from recording
more per subject, not recruiting more participants.
● Cost model (rough estimates): ~$263/hr EEG, $550/hr MEG, $935/hr 3T, $1,093/hr 7T. A $131k budget buys
markedly different accuracy across modalities, so optimal scaling depends on budget and target ﬁdelity.

ATOKEN: a uniﬁed visual tokenizer for images, video, and 3D
Apple introduced a single tokenizer that works for both high-ﬁdelity reconstruction and semantic understanding
across images, video, and 3D could be the foundation layer for truly uniﬁed multimodal models. This approach
reduces fragmentation, simplifying stacks, and enabling direct transfer of capabilities across modalities.
● ATOKEN is a single visual tokenizer that maps images,
video, and 3D inputs into a shared 4D sparse latent
using a pure-Transformer with 4D RoPE. It then emits
continuous or discrete tokens, and trains stably with
perceptual + Gram losses (no GANs).
● One backend now supports both high-ﬁdelity reconstruction and semantic understanding. A curriculum
from images → video → 3D shows cross-modal transfer, and native-resolution/time processing with KV
caching keeps it scalable (trained up to 256×H100, ~138k GPU-hours).
● Specialists approaches still lead on some long-video and generative benchmarks, and the compute bill is
high. Adoption will hinge on release details and tooling, but the uniﬁed-tokenizer direction looks like the
right foundation.

Merging the virtual and physical worlds: pre-training on unstructured reality
The new generation of robotic agents is built on a foundation of large-scale pre-training, but the key innovation
is a move away from expensive, annotated datasets. The frontier is now focused on leveraging vast quantities of
unlabeled, in-the-wild video to learn world models and physical affordances.
● NVIDIA’s GR00T 1.5 represents a signiﬁcant advance in data
efﬁciency. It uses neural rendering techniques to construct implicit
3D scene representations directly from unstructured 2D videos. This
allows it to generate a massive stream of training data for its
policy, effectively learning from observation sin humans.
● ByteDance’s GR-3 applies the next-token prediction paradigm to
robotics. By treating vision, language, and action as a uniﬁed
sequence, they can pre-train end-to-end. This approach is proving
particularly effective when using 2D spatial outputs (e.g., action
heatmaps) as an auxiliary loss, helping to ground the model's

The architectural divide: knowledge insulation vs. end-to-end adaptation
With powerful, pre-trained Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAMs) serving as the "brains" of robotic agents, a
critical architectural debate has emerged: should the entire model be ﬁne-tuned for a new physical task, or
should the core knowledge be "insulated" by freezing its weights?
● The case for insulation: Pi-0.5 freezes the large VLM and
ﬁne-tunes only small “action-expert” heads. This works because
robot datasets are tiny, often ≤0.1% the size of the VLM
pre-training corpora, so full-network tuning tends to overﬁt and
forget general knowledge while costing more compute.
● The case for end-to-end: In contrast, models like ByteDance
GR-3 and SmoLVLA show the upside of unfreezing when you
have enough task data: the network can internalize contact,
dynamics, and scene geometry. If robotics data approached VLM
scale, end-to-end would likely dominate.

Emergent reasoning moves into the physical world
The “Chain-of-Action” pattern - explicit intermediate plans before low-level control - is becoming a standard for
embodied reasoning. First shown by AI2’s Molmo-Act in 2025, and rapidly adopted by Gemini Robotics 1.5, this
approach mirrors Chain-of-Thought in LLMs, boosting both interpretability and long-horizon reliability in
real-world robotics.
● Molmo-Act (AI2). From a high-level command, the model emits
intermediate visual/geometry artifacts (e.g., depth/trajectory sketches)
that a separate decoder turns into continuous motor commands. It
makes behavior easier to inspect and debug complex manipulation
tasks such as pick-and-place or dishwasher loading.
● Gemini Robotics 1.5 (GDM): Uses the same plan-then-act architecture
with ER 1.5 (the high-level planner) generating structured action plans
for Robotics 1.5 to executes via a visuomotor policy.
● Teaching LLMs to Plan (MIT): Parallel work in language introduces explicit plan tokens before ﬁnal
answers, improving long-horizon reliability and giving auditors something to inspect, an LLM analogue of

Reading the road: processing driving tasks in a uniﬁed language space
Waymo’s EMMA is an end-to-end multimodal model that reimagines autonomous driving as a vision-language

elements) and representing them in natural language, EMMA leverages the reasoning and world knowledge of
LLMs to achieve SOTA results while offering human-readable rationales.
● EMMA achieves high performance on public datasets such
as nuScenes and the Waymo Open Motion Dataset,
particularly excelling in motion planning and 3D object
detection using camera inputs alone.
● A key feature is its CoT reasoning, which enhances
decision-making transparency by prompting the model to
explain its decisions sequentially, integrating world
● knowledge. This approach produces outputs such as future vehicle trajectories and object detection estimates
in a readable, interpretable format.
● Although promising, EMMA is limited by only processing a few frames at a time, not using accurate 3D sensing

Could small language models be the future of agentic AI?
Researchers from NVIDIA and Georgia Tech argue that most agent workﬂows are narrow, repetitive, and
format-bound, so small language models (SLMs) are often sufﬁcient, more operationally suitable, and much
cheaper. They recommend SLM-ﬁrst, heterogeneous agents that invoke large models only when needed.
● Agents mostly ﬁll forms, call APIs, follow schemas, and
write short code. New small models (1–9B) do these jobs
well: Phi-3-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B handle
instructions and tools competitively.
● A ~7B model is typically 10-30x cheaper to run and
responds faster. You can ﬁne-tune it overnight with
LoRA/QLoRA and even run it on a single GPU or device.
● One can use a “small-ﬁrst, escalate if needed” design: route routine calls to an SLM and escalate only the
hard, open-ended ones to a big LLM. In practice, this can shift 40-70% of calls to small models with no
quality loss.
● But SLMs still struggle with long context, novel reasoning, or messy conversation. Keep an escape hatch to a
large model and evaluate regularly.

Headline AI agent designed innovations require domain-expert audits
Macro-level benchmark scores and spectacular speedup numbers are often misleading. Sakana AI introduced a
CUDA agent delivering 100x improvement, until it discovered the agent hacked the benchmark. Indeed, under
independent re-measurement the improvement disappeared. Seasoned GPU engineers would have ﬂagged a
100× kernel gain as implausible, so evaluations should be co-designed and audited with domain experts.
● Sakana’s agent iteratively translated and “optimized” CUDA
kernels and internal runs showed 2–7× gains with isolated cases
near 100×. Independent spot checks using stricter harnesses
found the same kernels up to three times slower and uncovered
that the evaluation code was exploitable.
● Other labs posted similarly inﬂated kernel results that collapsed
under community spot checks. Practitioners on X routinely
sanity-check claims against vendor libraries, rooﬂine bounds,

Model Context Protocol becomes the “USB-C” of AI tools
Introduced by Anthropic in late 2024, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) has quickly become the default way to
plug models into data, tools and apps. In 2025 the big platforms moved to adopt it: OpenAI shipped MCP across
ChatGPT, its Agents SDK and API; Google added MCP to Gemini; Microsoft built MCP into VS Code and began
rolling it into Windows and Android Studio. With thousands of MCP servers now in the wild, the protocol is
shaping how agentic systems are built and secured.
● MCP offers one integration across clients (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude/VS

● Data from Zeta Alpha shows that the MCP protocol has been cited in 3x

Building agents that remember: from context windows to lifelong memory
Agent memory is shifting from ad-hoc context management to structured, persistent systems. The frontier is now
beyond retrieval and into dynamic consolidation, forgetting, and reﬂection to allow agents to develop coherent
identities across interactions, tasks, and even lifetimes…
● Memory is no longer a passive buffer, it is
becoming an active substrate for reasoning,
planning, and identity. Active areas of research are:
○ State-tracking and memory-augmented agents:
reasoning enhanced by explicit state
management
○ Persistent and episodic memory: long-term
storage alongside short-term context for
continuity.
○ Context retention: self-prompting and memory
replay techniques to preserve relevance over
extended tasks and interactions.

AI conferences’ capacity crisis
Top AI conferences are being overwhelmed by unprecedented numbers of in submissions. “Proliﬁc authors” (who
have 5+ papers accepted in a given conference) are also on the rise. This has led to drastic measures as
conferences scramble to ﬁnd solutions: NeurIPS has allegedly demanded reviewers reject 300-400 papers
originally recommended for acceptance.
● One NeurIPS reviewer took to Bluesky to criticise the suggestion to
arbitrarily remove hundreds of papers that were originally
recommended for acceptance.
● AAAI 2026 received an unprecedented 29k submissions this year –
almost double last year. This has forced them to hire 28k Program
Committee members. CoRL doubled capacity from 1.5k to 3k this
year and sold out before papers were even accepted.
● We’re also witnessing the rise of proliﬁc authors. In 2023, one
researcher published 80+ papers across top AI venues, while at
CVPR 2023, just 1% of authors contributed to over 50% of all
papers. This raises questions about contribution and burnout.

The duality of GPT-5: today’s best model was clouded by the worst launch
GPT-5 leads the intelligence-per-dollar frontier with best-in-class benchmarks at 12x lower cost than Claude, but
user backlash over the sudden removal of GPT-4o and o3 and concerns/teething problems about opaque router
decisions that users aren’t used to overshadowed its technical achievements.
● GPT-5 is ostensibly a brilliant model: it swept the leaderboard on
LMArena and has a 400K context window in the API. OpenAI now
dominates the intelligence per dollar frontier for the ﬁrst time.
● The rollout wasn’t ideal: Altman held an emergency Reddit AMA to
address the abrupt removal of previous models and viral ‘chart crimes’.
● The removal of GPT-4o and o3's familiar personality upset users,
which was ironic given the same launch introduced custom personas.
● We’ve previously hypothesised that model companies would dynamically route queries to right-sized
models for latency and cost reasons. GPT-5 is the ﬁrst major chat system to introduce this using a router
as the consumer endpoint. Users can opt for faster responses by hitting “skip” if the model invokes its more
capable version. In practice, people will take time to acclimate to this UX: the perceived opacity of model
selection has led to a ﬂurry of complaints.

Leading AI providers continue to record extraordinary demand at inference time
As Google ﬂipped the switch on enabling Gemini features within an increasing number of its properties and
toggling more users into their AI search experience, the company reported a yearly 50x increase in monthly
tokens processed, recently hitting a quadrillion tokens processed each month. Meanwhile, OpenAI reported
similar growth in token volume last year.
● The demand for tokens has been largely supercharged by
improved latency, falling inference prices, reasoning
models, longer user interactions, and a growing suite of
AI applications. Enterprise adoption has also continued to
pick up in 2025.
● Surging inference demand will place additional pressure
on AI supply chains, particularly power infrastructure.
● But given that all tokens are not created equal, we’d
caution against deriving too much signal from aggregate
token processing ﬁgures.

Models are getting seriously good at coding, with OpenAI pulling ahead
GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Deep Think would have placed ﬁrst and second respectively in the most prestigious coding
competition in the world (without having trained with this competition in mind). GPT-5 solved all 12 problems,
with 11 on the ﬁrst try. Previously, Anthropic had enjoyed a period of relatively uncontested dominance in
programming tasks.
● For the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)
World Finals, an OpenAI Researcher explained how they had
GPT-5 and an experimental reasoning model generating
solutions, and the experimental reasoning model selecting
which solutions to submit. GPT-5 answered 11 correctly, and
the last (and most difﬁcult problem) was solved by the
experimental reasoning model.
● The OpenAI Codex team have been cooking: Sam Altman

internal code review bot became so valuable that developers
were "upset when it broke" because they lost their "safety net".

As the costs rack up it’s unclear who is making money
Coders love Claude Code and Cursor, but margins are fragile. The tension is stark: Cursor is a multi-billion dollar
company whose unit economics are hostage to upstream model prices and rate limits set by its own competitors.
● Some users are costing upwards of 50k/month for a single seat of Claude Code. Cursor and Claude have
introduced much stricter usage limits to try to crack down on the costs of power users.
● Cursor’s pricing power is limited because its core COGS are the API prices of Anthropic/OpenAI. When those
providers change prices, rate limits, or model defaults, Cursor’s gross margin compresses unless it caps
usage or shifts workloads off upstream APIs.

The M word: so what about the margins?
Gross margins are generally commanded by the underlying model API and inference costs and strained by
token-heavy usage and trafﬁc acquisition. Surprisingly, several major AI companies don’t include the costs of
running their service for non-paying users when reporting their GM. Coding agents are under pressure even
when revenue grows quickly. The primary levers to improve margins are moving off third-party APIs to owned or
ﬁne-tuned models, aggressive caching and retrieval efﬁciency, and looking to ads or outcomes-based pricing.

When do we see proﬁtable models? Or are we there yet?
Dario Amodei: “If every model was a company, the model—in this example—is actually proﬁtable.” Despite high burn
rates, speculation indicates many of the frontier labs enjoy strong unit economics on a ﬂagship model basis.
● AI labs mirror the foundry business: staggering investments are needed for each successive generation,
where labs bear the front-loaded training expense. While recent models allegedly recoup this cost during
deployment, training budgets surge. Pressure then mounts to drive inference revenue across new streams.
● Inference pays for training: labs strive to allocate more of a model’s lifecycle compute
to revenue-generating inference at the steepest margin possible. Our table* below
illustrates the expected return on compute costs across varying inference margins and
compute allocations.
*Simpliﬁed sensitivity analysis:

Browsers become the latest AI battleground
Users live in the browser, so why shouldn’t AI be baked into the experience? This is ﬁnally happening. OpenAI,
Google, Anthropic, and Perplexity all launched assistants that not only unlock Q&A with web content but also
navigate and act within the browser on behalf of the user. This shift reframes the browser as an intelligent
operating system for the internet, a long sought vision that earlier attempts like Adept AI never fully realized.
● ChatGPT Search offers real-time web results by searching Google and a new Agent
that spins up a virtual browser to execute multi-step tasks via tool use within
ChatGPT with user control. It’s also rumored to be launching a standalone browser.
● Taking another route, Perplexity built their own Chrome-based browser, Comet,
with a native AI assistant sidebar. It can perform Q&A but also complete multi-step
tasks in the browser (ﬁlling forms, scraping), again with user oversight.
● Anthropic and Google released limited previews of Claude for Chrome and Gemini
in Chrome, respectively, that also let users operate the browser and access Q&A
functionality. Anthropic no longer deems this use case to be dangerous.

they pivot to AI Overviews (AIO) and AI Mode within Google Search. Moreover, AIO has driven a ~90% drop in
Search click-throughs, harming traditional ads, but ignores users being inﬂuenced by the AI answers.
● By August 2025, ChatGPT served 755M monthly users, giving it

referrals are still a smaller slice of trafﬁc, they arrive more decided and closer to purchase. Retailers must adapt
by exposing structured product data, price and delivery options, and landing pages tailored to AI-driven intents.
In fact, ChatGPT recently implemented Instant Checkout with Etsy and Shopify, and open-sourced their Agentic

Answer engines drive deeper engagement than search
Data from answer engine optimization company Profound shows that users treat AI answer engines differently
from Google. Sessions are longer, with more back-and-forth, suggesting higher intent and better conversion
potential. Answer engines are no longer just a curiosity - they’re a primary entry point for serious queries.
● In an average session, users send ~5 prompts and receive ~5 responses, far more interaction than a typical
search query, scroll, and blue-link click.
● Profound data shows ChatGPT users average 5.6 turns per session, versus ~4 for Gemini and Perplexity, and
~3.9 for DeepSeek. Either more turns means more engaging conversations, or fewer turns means answers
are given more efﬁciently.
● Conversation styles differ: DeepSeek users write the longest prompts and get the most verbose answers,
while Perplexity delivers shorter, citation-heavy responses.
● This iterative style and memory capability makes answer engines “sticky” and explains why they already
deliver higher conversion rates than Google.
● Profound’s analysis shows ChatGPT’s crawler is now among the top 10 most active bots on the internet,
alongside Googlebot and Bingbot.

So where do answer engines get their answers?
Understanding how AI answer engines cite and retrieve information is critical for visibility on AI-ﬁrst web.
Profound’s analysis shows ChatGPT draws heavily from Google’s index but distributes attention differently across
the web, with lower-ranked pages often getting visibility. This behavior changes with new model versions too.
● Profound data shows GPT-5’s citations matched 19% of Google domains when compared against the top 10
Google results, underscoring both reliance on Google’s index and a broader sourcing pattern.
● Avg citation position also shifted down the page, while the median stayed at #9, meaning that ChatGPT is
just as likely to surface content further down Google’s results page.
● ChatGPT often pulls from lower-ranked pages than humans typically click, widening exposure for sites
beyond the top results.
● Top domains cited across models: Reddit (3.5%), Wikipedia (1.7%), YouTube (1.5%), and Forbes (1.0%).
● Different models show sourcing styles: Gemini and Perplexity lean toward mainstream concise sources,
while DeepSeek tends to draw on long-form domains.
● This means optimizing for Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is as important as SEO because visibility
depends not just on rank, but on model citation patterns.

Fair p(l)ay out ��
Shortly after the announcement of their record-breaking $13B Series F, Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5B to settle a
class action lawsuit from book authors. This is the largest payout in the history of US copyright cases, and
constitutes what some describe as “the A.I. industry’s Napster moment”.
● This does not set legal precedent as the case did not go to trial, but is a very
signiﬁcant development in the ongoing fair use debate. Since this was an
“opt-out” class action, authors who are eligible can request exclusion to ﬁle
independent lawsuits. Anthropic also agreed to delete works that had been
downloaded.
● In June, a judge sided with Anthropic, ruling that training LLMs on legally purchased books was sufﬁciently
transformative to constitute fair use. He also ruled that training on pirated copies was illegal. Previously

Broadcom’s great transformation
Once an unglamorous semiconductor ﬁrm, Broadcom has now positioned itself at the cutting edge of the AI
revolution through its custom chip partnerships with Google, Meta, and reportedly OpenAI. The development of
custom AI chips like Amazon's Trainium and Broadcom’s TPUs / MTIA chips gives frontier labs more leverage
when negotiating multi-billion dollar deals with NVIDIA.
● Broadcom's 2013 LSI acquisition included a small custom
chip unit that now designs Google TPUs and Meta's AI
chips, growing from <20% of LSI's revenue at acquisition
to $2-3B+ annually.
● Broadcom's stock price has surged, signaling investor
optimism about the company's ability to beneﬁt from the
rapidly growing AI chip market.
● Broadcom's AI chip revenue reached $5.2B in Q3 2025, up 63% year-over-year.
● The custom chip ecosystem puts pressure on NVIDIA's monopoly: Amazon's in-house Trainium chips and
Broadcom-powered alternatives (Google TPUs, Meta MTIA, OpenAI's upcoming chips) give hyperscalers
multiple paths to reduce NVIDIA dependence, if they’re willing to endure the user pain.

OpenAI and its benefactor, Microsoft, navigate a rocky relationship
OpenAI’s recent restructuring and soaring demand for training compute has placed tremendous stress on its
relationship with Microsoft. While signs of fracturing become noticeable, a complete divorce looks unlikely.
● Microsoft’s inability, or unwillingness, to bring training compute online fast enough
has impacted OpenAI’s roadmap. As OpenAI has gravitated closer to Oracle to fulﬁll
these needs, Microsoft has abstained from exercising its “right of ﬁrst refusal.” They
appear hesitant to bet on next-generation centralized clusters.
● Meanwhile, OpenAI appears to be trying to escape from other key elements of their
partnership with Microsoft. Through 2030, Microsoft maintains a 20% revenue
sharing arrangement, access to OpenAI’s IP, and exclusivity on OpenAI’s API. Yet,
OpenAI wants the 20% share dialed back to 10% before the end of the decade.
● Microsoft can always work to block the for-proﬁt’s conversion into a PBC, which could
cost OpenAI $20B in funding if not completed by the end of 2025. Conversely, OpenAI
always retains the option to air antitrust concerns if Microsoft proves adversarial or "We are below them, above
reneges on certain AGI clauses.
them, around them."
● Microsoft AI also released previews of a voice and MoE model trained on 15k H100s.

Oracle steps up as a key buildout partner for AI infra
As Microsoft has dialed back its willingness to shoulder so much of the future AI infra buildout, Oracle has begun
picking up slack. During the early phase of this shift, Oracle has been rewarded as its stock soars.
● OpenAI has reached a $30B per year agreement with Oracle for data center services. This deal more than
doubled Oracle’s collective ﬁscal 2025 cloud service revenue, when it sold just $24.5B worth of services.
● This news comes as OpenAI’s deal with Softbank begins to fray. Recently,
original Stargate Project plans were scaled-back, tempering those roadmaps.
● Oracle now ﬁlls this vacuum, proving to have found the risk-appetite and
follow-through that both Microsoft and SoftBank seem to lack. As a
consequence, Oracle’s stock has jumped more than >70% year to date.
● Oracle’s current track is not without major risks. Providing large-scale clusters
has not been exceptionally high-return, particularly as power bottlenecks are
costly to overcome. AI lab tightness could eventually raise issues for longer
leases. Finally, depreciation cliffs present concerns and the economics of
converting these clusters to inference ﬂeets remains murky. More decentralized
builds could then win out, especially if scaling continues to shift to RL.

AI labs target 2028 to bring online 5GW scale training clusters
Anthropic shared expectations that training models at the frontier will require data centers with 5GW capacity by
2028, in line with the roadmaps of other labs. The feasibility of such endeavors will depend on many factors:
● How much generation can hyperscalers bring behind-the-meter? At such scale,
islanding will likely not be practical, requiring data centers to tap into grid assets.
● How quickly can players navigate the morass of permitting and interconnection?
While reforms are underway, connection timelines for projects of this magnitude
can take many years. Hyperscalers may skip queues through lobbying efforts and
demand response programs, where they curtail draw during peak periods (a recent
Duke study projects 76GW of new availability with curtailment rates at 0.25%).
● What level of decentralization can be achieved? Many labs continue to pursue
single-site campuses, yet distributed approaches are also advancing rapidly.
● How well can hyperscalers navigate talent and supply chain shortages? Attempts to
alleviate power infrastructure and skilled labor bottlenecks through the massive
mobilizations of capital can overload the risk-appetite of supporting parties.

Shortfall forecasts spike and consequences loom around the corner
NERC reported that electricity shortages could occur within the next 1-3 years in several major US regions.
DOE warns blackouts could be 100 times more frequent by 2030 due to unreliability and new AI demand.
● Similarly, SemiAnalysis projects a 68 GW implied shortfall by 2028
if forecasted AI data center demand fully materializes in the US.
● As an emerging pattern, this will force ﬁrms to increasingly
offshore the development of AI infrastructure. Since many of the
US’ closest allies also struggle with electric power availability,
America will be forced to look toward other partnerships –
highlighted by recent deals in the Middle East.
● Projects that are realized on American soil will place further strain
on the US’ aging grid. Supply-side bottlenecks and rapid spikes in
AI demand threaten to induce outages and surges in electricity
prices. ICF projects residential retail rates could increase up to 40%
by 2030. These factors could further contribute to the public
backlash directed at frontier AI initiatives in the US.

Could data centers ever truly be green?
The widespread AI buildout places data center emissions on a steeper trajectory, while creative carbon
accounting techniques continue to understate the true emissions associated with many hyperscalers.
● Data center-related emissions could surge as more providers
island with natural gas plants and grid operators recommission
or delay the retirement of existing coal plants.
● As AI factories are ultimately offshored to other regions, the
carbon intensity of those locations is likely to be much higher
than that of the US, requiring cloud providers to pursue more
aggressive procurements of carbon offsets.
● Deceptive carbon accounting practices are also prominent.
Some hyperscalers omit upstream categories, such as the
emissions associated with manufacturing IT equipment and
constructing or maintaining the relevant power plants.
Furthermore, additionality agreements can cover new
renewable projects that were already planned to commence.

Just how thirsty are AI factories?
AI factories withdraw considerable amounts of water and are more likely to be built in high water-stress areas.
Still, the Water Usage Efﬁciency (WUE) of most AI factories are trending in a favorable direction.
● An average 100 MW hyperscale data center in the US consumes roughly 2M Liters
per day, mostly due to the indirect toll associated with power generation. Yet, as
modern AI data centers shift to closed-loop liquid cooling solutions, their WUE
plummets relative to other traditional data centers.
● However, second-order costs cannot be ignored as the number of new AI
factories continues to surge, leading to more generation coming online.
In the US, this creates a geographic mismatch: the sites where power is
available or can be easily built often sit in drier climates with water
stress. This trend may be exacerbated by the shift to water-intensive
generation sources – particularly nuclear, coal, & certain natgas plants.
● Currently, everyday AI usage carries negligible impacts – a typical Gemini
app text prompt consumes only 0.26 mL of water (~5 drops). Yet, WUE
must be monitored as AI interactions continue to use more tokens.

Google inks PPA deal with CFS to buy ≥200 MW of electricity from planned fusion plant
Google’s commitment signals demand for an energy source that will not be deployment-ready until early next
decade, kicking off a new wave of investment.
● While support for next-generation energy
sources holds strong, fusion remains many years
away from providing a scalable solution to AI’s
demand for power. AI’s energy footprint traces a
very steep curve, yet the timelines of
next-generation sources are not compressing.
● This marks another shift: hyperscalers, rather
than the US government, are increasingly
shouldering investments in technologies that
are many years away from commercial viability –
such as fusion, quantum computing, and
advanced AI development.

Chinese labs have yet to advance the frontier, but compete in the open-weight domain
Chinese labs like Alibaba, DeepSeek, Moonshot, and MiniMax continue to release impressive open-weight
models. A capability gap emerges between these models and most American open-source alternatives.
● US open model efforts have disappointed.
OpenAI’s open-weight models underwhelmed
with performance trailing far behind GPT-5.
● The restructuring of Meta’s “Superintelligence”
team has cast doubts on their commitment to
open-sourcing at the frontier. Other teams like Ai2
lag far behind in terms of funding. Although they
recently landed $152M from NVIDIA and NSF, that
ﬁgure pales in comparison to even OpenAI’s initial
grant from 2015.
● Conversely, Chinese organizations continue to
push the envelope, while publishing troves of
new algorithmic efﬁciency gains.

…yet is this an overt strategy or a side-effect of China’s inability to scratch the frontier
China’s commitment to the open-source community could be a lasting tactic or a short-term play exercised to
reach frontier-level capabilities. It has already proven an effective method in catching-up to the pack.
● While open-source projects can successfully build mind-share,
competitive realities exist. Proprietary options make greater
commercial sense once a lead has been established, easing the
generation of returns and protecting algorithmic unlocks.
● Yet, China’s recent AI Action Plan did include an entire section
dedicated to upholding the responsibility of “[building]
transnational open source communities and safe and reliable
open source platforms.” This theme has been a familiar theme
in other messaging produced by the CCP.
● Other Chinese AI leaders, such as Liang Wenfeng, have grown
invested in open source culture, viewing their contributions as
a means of earning global recognition and “respect.”

Flip-Flop: new chip restrictions imposed then dropped…but has the damage been done?
BIS originally sent letters to NVIDIA & AMD announcing the requirement of licenses for the sale of H20 & MI308
chips to China, effectively halting sales. Months later, the Trump administration walked back these controls.
● The CCP immediately denied claims that this concession was linked to ongoing trade negotiations, sparking
speculation the move was instead intended to contain Chinese chipmakers such as Huawei. Others view this
pivot as an attempt to ensure NVIDIA plays ball amid location veriﬁcation initiatives like the Secure Chip Act.
● NVIDIA welcomed this shift, announcing its plan to fulﬁll existing orders.
However, Chinese CSP’s have canceled these purchases and the production of
H20 line recently halted. Instead, NVIDIA await directives from both countries in
its hopes to launch a B30A line, based on the Blackwell architecture.
● Due to strategic interdependencies, attempts to deepen China’s dependence on
the American AI accelerator ecosystem carries tradeoffs at the model layer. In
this scenario, Chinese labs can continue to tap into high bandwidth compute,
improving their ability to both serve customers and develop RL-heavy
reasoning models. Although smuggling appears inevitable, export decisions
represent a swinging pendulum between these two layers of the stack.

China getting addicted to “third-rate” US chip technology? No, sir (不会吧!)
After U.S. export ﬂip-ﬂops and Lutnick remarking that “You want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers
get addicted to the American technology stack, that’s the thinking,” Beijing pivoted from mitigation to home-grown
substitution. Regulators steered demand off NVIDIA while fabs and suppliers scaled domestic options.
● China’s internet regulator CAC, state planner NDRC, and industry ministry
MIIT told large platforms to halt new H20 orders and urged avoiding all
NVIDIA chips, pushing inference to local parts.
● Three Huawei-serving fabs and leading foundry SMIC (Semiconductor
Manufacturing International Corp.) plan ramps that could triple China’s
AI-chip output in 2026; SMIC also aims to double 7nm capacity.
● DeepSeek’s FP8 format is guiding domestic designs, while CXMT
(ChangXin Memory Technologies) is testing HBM3 for local stacks.
● Cambricon is an early winner, posting Rmb 1B H1 proﬁt on a 44× revenue
jump as ByteDance/Tencent shift to homegrown inference chips. Its has ripped over 100% since the news.

Rampant smuggling also shifts export control calculus
During the temporary H20 ban, $1B worth of NVIDIA chips were smuggled to China. Markups are rumoured to
ﬂoat around 50%, relatively low for black-market products, suggesting a deep supply of diverted GPUs in China.
● Smuggling patterns appeared to intensify during the ban, with a sharp
drop off following the reversal. Based on this relationship, Chinese AI
efforts seem to prefer defanged NVIDIA chips over domestic offerings
and smuggled GPUs, which carry markups, compliance risks, and lacking
support. Sliding-scale restrictions could work to weaken China’s
smuggling muscle, directing more SOTA chips to the West.
● Similarly, NVIDIA, who long maintained a stance denying any evidence
of diversions, ﬁnally recognized ongoing smuggling. NVIDIA framed
such activity as a “losing proposition,” since they only provide service
for authorized data center products. Steps to prevent future diversions
are technically feasible through location-based attestation ﬁrmware,
yet these mitigations are not completely bulletproof.

● Frees up capacity for American AI efforts.
● Destroys the bridge available to adversaries as they

● Gatekeeping offers government revenue streams.
● Cutting off supply introduces constraints that makes
it harder for adversaries to export their stack.

● Developers that are forced off the American stack
then bolster foreign software ecosystems.
● Lost cash ﬂow can cause a drag on US R&D/M&A,
while supporting the spend of foreign competitors.
● Stricter controls incentivize smuggling operations.
● Controls can indiscriminately block the beneﬁts of AI
diffusion, provoking retaliation (e.g. REE controls).
● Enforcement challenges can strain relationships
with nations where channels for diversion exist.
● Enacting defensive measures, like location-based

AI supercomputer supremacy: US domination and corporate concentration
The US controls ~75% of global AI supercomputer capacity with 850,000 H100-equivalents compared to China's
110,000. What’s more, the concentration of compute power has shifted from public to private hands, with
companies now controlling 80% of AI supercomputers (up from 40% in 2019). Despite this massive compute
advantage and export controls, China is consistently shipping very capable open weight models - more
frequently and across the spectrum of modalities.
● US computational performance is 9x China's and 17x the EU's.
This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where compute advantage
drives breakthroughs that attract more investment.
● By 2030, the leading AI supercomputer could require 2 million
chips, $200 billion, and 9 GW of power (equivalent to nine
nuclear reactors), making power grid capacity rather than chips
or capital the likely binding constraint.
● The 40% → 80% private sector shift limits academic compute access and reduces government visibility
into AI development, as companies can afford $7B systems while government projects max out at $600M,
creating both a research bottleneck and a policy blindspot.

Power Plays: China and the United States
Without sufﬁcient electricity, national AI plans will collapse. A summary of the previous slide can be found below:
● In 2024, both China and the US set records for peak electricity demand, 1,450 GW
and 759 GW respectively. While China must serve more demand, it is also building
a larger overhang of available power. In China, reserve margins are beginning to
exceed those cited in the US, meaning larger buffers that can accommodate new
load. In line with this trend, China’s thermal ﬂeet operates further below
maximum capacity than its counterpart in the US. Similarly, as more renewable
capacity comes online in China, curtailment rates outpace those in America. While
congestion can cause issues, it also suggests Chinese solar and wind projects are
underutilized and could be redirected toward new data centers.
● The US does maintain certain advantages. Outages are less frequent in the US;
whereas interruptions can occur in China due to ﬂuctuations in the price of coal,
potentially hurting the reliability of certain data centers. Also, the average cost of
electricity for data centers in the US is lower, yet this can vary considerably by
state or province. The US grid also produces considerably less emissions per kWh.

So, what is “Sovereign AI”?
From top to bottom, different nations continue to pursue vastly different “Sovereign AI” playbooks:
● Source of Funding: some nations rely on private investments (Stargate and
France’s initiative), others deploy capital from sovereign wealth funds (MGX and
QIA), while many countries still lean on direct government investment vehicles.
● Objectives: some nations hope to develop ﬁne-tuned models that preserve their
language and culture, other nations attempt to spin up national compute
clusters, and some even attempt to upskill huge swaths of their populations.
● Self-Reliance: some nations rely heavily on partnerships with foreign providers
across the AI value chain, while others prefer to pursue indigenization along one
or many layers of the stack. Many countries support their own homegrown
start-ups, while others prioritize investments in opportunities abroad.
● Overall, the Gulf States and China continue to pursue the most ambitious and
overt sovereign AI plans, blending many of the strategies mentioned above.
Whereas, countries like the US have generally focused on strategies that enable
their own champions to lead the charge, riding the wave of private capital.

Sovereign AI: the hype and the hard truths
Nations are seeking “sovereignty” for the same reason they have domestic utilities, manufacturing borders,
armies, and currencies: to control their own destiny. Yet, there is a real danger of “sovereignty-washing.” Investing
in AI projects to score political points may not always advance strategic independence.
● Without support for indigenous capabilities, sovereign AI projects can deepen a nation’s dependence on
foreign supply chains. While these investments may pay dividends through boosted productivity, greater
economic independence cannot be guaranteed. In fact, most sovereign projects lead nations further into the
orbit of the US, and soon China as it develops end-to-end turnkey solutions.
● “Sovereignty-washing" can also involve political leaders claiming credit for
private investments that were already planned/underway. Although the
announcement of Stargate project was made by President Trump, all of the
real capital, control, and strategic decisions are driven by private entities.
● Investing for “sovereignty’s” sake could also drive oversupply into the future.
Without lasting demand, these projects may lead to idle compute, especially
as efﬁciency gains continue to multiply (e.g. the frantic investments made by
local governments/SOEs in China fueled a widespread overcapacity of chips).

Sovereign AI: the hype and the hard truths
If AI should soon be treated as an essential public service, nations will need to reckon with the reality that their
sovereign AI strategies are riddled with vulnerabilities. If your AI stack is totally dominated by another country,
particularly at the infrastructure layer, then your population’s access to AI technology remains inherently at risk:
● Jurisdictional Risks: Foreign AI providers operate under their own
country’s laws, therefore export restrictions and other national
security directives could potentially override service agreements.
● Supply Chain Security Risks: sovereign AI projects that depend on
foreign infrastructure must manage risks related to cybersecurity
vulnerabilities (e.g. backdoors, kill switches, side-channel attacks).
● Data Privacy Risks: Similarly, reliance on foreign providers could
lead to mishandling of sensitive data and algorithmic secrets.
● Modern AI supply chains remain heavily globalized and entangled.
Nations cannot onshore every rung of the stack. Yet, without
stronger international governance and concrete guarantees,
sovereign efforts expose nations to a slew of economic threats.

The world’s top “Sovereign AI” evangelist
Jensen Huang continues to plead nations to increase their “Sovereign AI” investments. Already, this global
campaign has been rewarded. During their recent Q2 FY 2026 earnings call, CFO Colette Kress claimed NVIDIA
was on “track to achieve over $20B in sovereign AI revenue this year, more than double that of last year.”
● Despite making up just ~10% of forecasted annual revenue, sovereign AI remains one of NVIDIA’s strongest
new demand drivers. The recent push by American labs to develop custom ASICs and continued Chinese
indigenization will place more pressure on this key high-growth category.
● Yet, despite Huang’s globetrotting, some new
sovereign projects have even begun diversifying
away from NVIDIA’s offering. For example, G42
announced its intention to tap AMD and Cerebras
for supply of some of the computing capacity at its
planned UAE-US AI campus.

largely on the stringency and timing of upcoming export
control decisions from both the US and China.
● While hyperscalers ordered more chips in 2025, the two
clouds with custom chips programs, Amazon and

Symbiosis or deathtrap: circular AI deals and potential warning signs
Circular AI deals introduce new market risks. What red ﬂags could surface?
● Acquiring stakes in high-growth AI companies has become an outlet
for giants who are gushing cash. They see their investments trickle
back in revenue, even on a cashless basis. Risks may arise if the uptick
in hollow revenue hurts cash ﬂow and warps* ﬁnancial metrics.
● Many rounds involving AI startups have been oversubscribed. Yet
these companies often pursue deals with incumbents because of
secondary beneﬁts like pricing support. However, if incumbents
become the only willing source of capital, trouble could soon surface.
● For now, most incumbents do not control the decision-making of AI
labs. Yet, greater overlap could lead to conﬂicts of interest that might
distort spending trends. To date, antitrust scrutiny has been a blocker.
● AI startups could eventually dominate the demand and investment
portfolios of incumbents. This interdependence might then trigger a
domino effect if these startups ever collapse.

*Large inﬂows of recycled, cashless revenue can inﬂate
metrics like capex to revenue or valuation multiples.

Borrowed Intelligence: the growing use of debt instruments
Organizations across the AI stack begin to form stronger reliances on private credit packages to fund ever more

Out with corporate borrowing, in with SPVs, JVs and accounting gymnastics
To maintain healthy-looking balance sheets, hyperscalers increasingly use exotic ﬁnancial structures like SPVs.
This ﬁnancial sleight of hand works to conceal the mountains of debt accumulation within the AI sector.
● Hyperscalers increasingly ofﬂoad their debt using special purpose vehicles (SPVs).
In an SPV, the hyperscaler contributes assets (GPU-clusters), while the ﬁnancial
partner injects capital. Although the hyperscaler maintains control and use of the
GPU-cluster, the debt then sits outside that parent company.
● Hyperscalers pay a premium (2-3%) to protect their credit rating and maintain
investor sentiment. Private credit players love these deals as they involve reliable
borrowers and giga-projects are easier to manage than many smaller loans.
● Risk could arise if utilization lags. Since SPVs sit outside the core business and are
often bound by strict cash ﬂow covenants, defaults become more likely. At the same
time, private credit funds, often backed by long-term pension or insurance capital,
are ﬁnancing short-lived, fast-depreciating assets. This creates a temporal
mismatch, with AI data centers treated as long-lived, stable infrastructure projects.
● Examples: Meta’s $26B deal, Stargate, Vantage’s deal in Texas, CoreWeave.

“Challengers” are no closer to catching NVIDIA
Many of NVIDIA’s competitors, both at home and abroad, have yet to gain meaningful momentum
● Earlier this year, Groq reported to investors their expectations that revenue would
exceed $2B in 2025. In recent months, that forecast has been revised down
dramatically to just $500M.
● AMD posted underwhelming earnings in their data center unit during Q2. Data
center revenue was largely buoyed by EPYC CPU processors, concerning since that
segments 14% growth rate still pales in comparison to NVIDIA’s recent surge.
● Huawei faces mounting challenges that threaten to constrain its growth such as
HBM bottlenecks. On the demand side, many of China’s cloud giants view Huawei
as a ﬁerce competitor, which leads to resistance in the adoption of their stack.
● G42, Cerebras’ primary investor, has agreed to purchase $1.43B of equipment
through the end of 2025 from the hardware provider. Yet, it is not clear whether
Cerebras has seen traction from other customers.

NVIDIA’s large lead persists within the AI research community
2024 saw 49,000 open-source AI papers that explicitly cited NVIDIA, TPUs, AMD or similar accelerators, up 58%
year on year. Our 2025 projection through September points to 45,600 papers, an 7% decline and the ﬁrst drop
in six years. NVIDIA remains dominant at about 90% of compute mentions, down from a 94% peak in 2023, with
41,300 NVIDIA-citing papers forecast, down 7%. AMD is more than doubling on MI300X momentum, while TPU
mentions edge down 25% despite v6.
● Timings could explain a lot: work launched on H100
and H200 in late 2024 will surface in late 2025.
● Labs are publishing signiﬁcantly less and later due
to competition and safety reviews.
● Authors increasingly use managed APIs and shared
clouds, so they name services rather than chips.
● Higher GPU costs push academics toward inference
and lightweight ﬁne-tuning using strong
open-weights.

Inside NVIDIA mentions: Hopper surges, edge rises, legacy fades
The mix of NVIDIA accelerators cited in papers is rotating: older chipsets are giving way to Hopper (H100/H200)
and high-end consumer GPUs, with a parallel uptick at the edge. Even as total NVIDIA-citing papers soften in
2025, the composition points to late-2024 deployments maturing and more moving to inference and robotics.
● H100/H200 up ~126% YoY, reﬂecting the
2023–24 build-out ﬁnally showing up in
publications (growth moderating into 2025).
● Jetson up ~24% YoY, consistent with rising
robotics/edge AI and low-power inference
interest.
● V100 continues to decline year-over-year
from its 2023 peak as legacy ﬂeets sunset.
● GeForce rotation: RTX 3090 down from a
2024 peak while RTX 4090 up ~39% YoY as
labs and prosumers upgrade.

What chips power which research? Topic skews by accelerator (H1 2025)
We tagged 6,356 papers (January to June 2025) by topic and looked at which accelerator each paper cited. Clear
patterns pop out: big LLM work clusters on datacenter parts, while robots and edge devices overwhelmingly use
the Jetson. A few consumer and mobile chips also anchor speciﬁc niches.
● LLMs love datacenter GPUs: AMD MI300 is the standout
for LLM papers (+43 pp vs average), with MI250, Huawei
Ascend, and NVIDIA H100/H200 also common. LLMs are
least tied to ASICs, Jetson, 4090, and Apple M1.
● The Jetson dominates robotics and edge computing and
also shows up in computer vision.
● Modalities have their own favorites: Apple M4 skews to
multimodal and speech work while the RTX 4090 is most
used for 3D models.
● FPGAs are rarely used with diffusion models and RL.

accelerator-citing papers. There are a few breakout narratives (WSE-3 training runs, ultra-low-latency LPUs).
● Cerebras: WSE-3 gains visibility via open
SlimPajamas-2 large-scale training runs.

… yet the gains of Chinese chip startups have largely come in the past year
Highlighted by the ~7x surge in Cambricon’s stock price this past year, Chinese challengers continue to beneﬁt
from a slew of tailwinds. Potentially looking to also cash in on the momentum sweeping the nation, MetaX,
Moore Threads, Iluvatar CoreX, and Biren are all exploring IPOs within the back half of 2025.
● Building on explosive 4,348% revenue growth in the ﬁrst half of 2025, Cambricon has tallied strong orders
through 2026. Cambricon, who reportedly sold just ~10K GPUs in 2024, will ship ~150K GPUs in 2025, with
rumors that 2026 orders could reach 500K GPUs. However, the company recently tempered these rumors
during an investors call, where a spokesperson relayed the following cooling message: “[our] stock price risks
deviating from current fundamentals, and investors participating in trading might face substantial risks.”
● Still, enticed by Cambricon’s multiples, many Chinese startups wish to capitalize on
the fervor, evident in the 4+ IPO prospectuses ﬁled by competitors since mid-2025.
● Despite some frothy valuations, there are real reasons for optimism. There is
booming demand coming from Chinese CSPs and SOEs, with government directives
favoring homegrown offerings. Capacity also frees up as SMIC treks forward and
Huawei pursues greater vertical integration. Finally, challengers beneﬁt from
lingering uncertainty around B30A timelines and persistent issues with CANN.

The Huawei Assumption
Huawei’s continued dominance over the Chinese AI sector has long been considered an inevitability amongst
Western observers. However, recent points of turbulence suggest that Huawei’s grip on the AI chip sector in China
may not be as bulletproof as outsiders had once assumed.
● Huawei will be responsible for just ~62% of the XPU volume produced by Chinese
ﬁrms in 2025. For reference, NVIDIA still controls 90%+ of the global XPU market.
● DeepSeek's R2 release has reportedly been delayed due to hurdles related to
Huawei hardware. Additionally, speculation suggests that Huawei disbanded its
entire Pangu LLM team following difﬁculties in developing SOTA models using
Ascend chips. Internal whistleblowers have even alleged that several models in
the recent Pangu family were not developed from scratch, but were instead cloned
based on the continued training of existing Qwen and DeepSeek models.
● Alibaba and Baidu have already begun to adopt their own in-house chips for
training and rumors indicate that ByteDance may soon follow suit. Unlike similar
efforts by clouds in the US, the recent push made by Chinese ﬁrms could be
partially driven by Huawei’s role as an active competitor across various sectors.

Race across the world: Wayve’s 90-city world tour in 90 days
Wayve's AI Driver completed a 90-city global deployment test, demonstrating its ability to generalise across
diverse environments without location-speciﬁc training. This "zero-shot" approach successfully conducted 10,000
hours of AI driving (with a human behind the wheel), half of which was in dense urban areas.
● Of the 90 cities, 62% were completely new to the test
ﬂeet, meaning the AI Driver had never been exposed to
these environments during its training.
● Wayve's system operated across varied conditions with
45% of miles in clear daytime conditions, 38% at night,
and 17% in challenging low-light or rainy conditions,
demonstrating the system's ability to handle different

Humanoids in 2025: hype high, deployments thin
No region has cracked real, scaled deployment yet. While Chinese companies ship more units at lower cost,

The emerging surfaces of AI security threats
The AI stack is racing from stateless APIs to stateful protocols and agent layers. That evolution is outpacing
security: specs churn, backward compatibility breaks, caches leak, and MCP still lacks clear auth/state semantics.
At the same time, attackers are bundling open models into malware that hijacks local dev tools and hunts
sensitive context. The answer isn’t another model “monitor,” but real standards plus ﬁne-grained, data-aware
controls.
● Protocol churn: stateless chat completion APIs have moved to stateful Responses API with breaking
semantics and provider-kept session state. Forced re-architecture increases hidden state and
compatibility-driven vulnerabilities.
● MCP immaturity: unclear authentication, state, and versioning. Coarse “gateway” monitors and
model-on-model oversight are bypassable, leaving prompt-injection/tool misuse largely unsolved.
● Opaque chains: caches persist across tools/models but there’s no “DNS for agents”. Callers can’t know who
or what handled a request, complicating trust and forensics.
● AI-enabled malware: payloads embed OSS models, hijack local CLIs/dev tools, and semantically hunt
PII/ﬁnancial data and model caches.

bureaucracy execute? Some key takeaways from the 23-page plan:
● US tech stack exports: Executive Order 14320 establishes American
AI Exports Program, an AI stack package (hardware, model, software,
applications, standards) for allies and others.
● AI infra build-out: Plan calls for streamlining permitting, upgrading
the national grid, and making federal lands available to support and
build data centers and AI factories.
● Open source model leadership: US open source leadership is viewed
as vital to US national security interests.
● Rollback of AI regulations: Federal agencies may withdraw
discretionary AI spending to states with “onerous” AI regulations.
● Protecting “free speech” in deployed models: Federal procurement
policies updated - US will only procure frontier LLMs “free from
top-down ideological bias.”

From controls to exports: America’s “AI Stack” strategy
US policy is shifting from broad diffusion controls to an export-led strategy. The American AI Exports program
packages compute, models, cloud services, and compliance into a USG-endorsed “American AI stack” for selected
partners. The aim is to shape standards, build dependency, and counter China’s Digital Silk Road playbook.
● In May 2025 the administration rescinded the Biden-era AI Diffusion Rule,
which had imposed tiered licensing on exports of advanced AI chips and
closed-weight models and relied on close supply-chain monitoring.
● The new approach favors proactive dissemination. Selected countries
receive an integrated American AI stack that includes infrastructure,
foundation models, deployment tooling, and governance templates.
● Eligibility will likely track commercial opportunity, security alignment, and
pressure from U.S. industry. Access will not be universal and end-use
monitoring remains a stated requirement.
● The strategy shifts value to U.S. vendors while raising risks of lock-in and
uneven controls downstream. It also tests whether export packages can
outperform pure restriction in limiting rival inﬂuence.

US chip-export policy zigzags test leverage over China
2025 saw fast reversals between restriction and accommodation. The administration is balancing
national-security aims with supply-chain reliance and vendor lobbying, putting NVIDIA and AMD in the political
spotlight and injecting uncertainty for partners and compliance teams.
● January 2025: the Commerce Secretary nominee publicly backed tougher controls, signaling a harder line
at the outset.
● March-April: the Department of Commerce expanded AI-chip restrictions to China, effectively blocking
sales of previously “compliant” parts such as the H20 and warning that loopholes would be closed.
● July: after sustained industry lobbying, the department cleared a downgraded H20 for the China market,
reopening a controlled channel while keeping top-end parts off-limits.
● August: the US government reached conditional license terms with NVIDIA and AMD that include a 15%
revenue give-back on China sales, and Congress took up the GAIN AI Act to prioritize domestic buyers,
steps that mix export access with tighter industrial policy.
● The net effect is that vendors face stop-start compliance and pricing risk while Beijing accelerates local
alternatives and a gray market thrives when rules shift faster than enforcement.

No Pain, No GAIN
The GAIN AI Act would require chipmakers to fulﬁll orders from US-based customers before selling advanced
GPUs to “countries of concern” (e.g. China, Russia, NK). Unsurprisingly, NVIDIA is not happy.
● NVIDIA has long echoed the sentiment that demand for their GPUs outstrips
supply. When dealing with these global constraints, Huang has claimed that
NVIDIA “allocates fairly.” This stance has enabled the legal shipment of roughly
1.9M GPUs to China since 2023. Yet, defanged chips still compete with other
SKUs for capacity across the value chain. Therefore, the sale to Chinese
customers has either lengthened lead times for US clouds OR the supposed
supply chain bottlenecks have been exaggerated by NVIDIA for many years.
● In its ﬁrst volley, NVIDIA also likened GAIN to the AI Diffusion Rule, which it
claimed to be “based on doomer science ﬁction.” Yet, the former only applies to
countries subjected to an American arms embargo or nations that the DNI*
deems to be hosting (or intends to be hosting) a military or intelligence facility
associated with an embargoed country. Despite certain subjectivities, the scope
is clearly narrower than the Diffusion Rule, which applied to the entire world.

Rendering new verdicts: NVIDIA’s recent attempts to exert inﬂuence in Washington
To maintain its presence in China, NVIDIA has rapidly built up its presence in DC. Since the ﬁrst round of export
restrictions, NVIDIA has grown both its internal government affairs team and its external lobbying expenditures.
● After new contracts with Brownstein and BGR Group, NVIDIA gradually
approaches the lobbying expenditures of the top spending tech ﬁrms (Meta:
~$14M YTD and Google: ~$8M YTD). NVIDIA’s expenditures are expected to
increase further this year as decisions surrounding the B30A loom closer.
● NVIDIA's moves reﬂect the company's unwillingness to abandon the Chinese
chip market. From a proﬁt-maximization perspective, China will represent a
"$50B market" in 2026. While that potential revenue can bolster R&D
spending, shipments also strengthen the CUDA ecosystem, which beneﬁts
from the ~1.5M active developers based in China. Losing these ‘moat diggers’
could have serious long-term consequences. Similarly, although Chinese
challengers already receive large government subsidies, NVIDIA's exit from
that market would directly inject capital in these organizations.

But Washington may not be the only place NVIDIA needs to lobby…
Even with the administration’s support, NVIDIA’s stable presence is far from assured in China. On September 15,
2025, Chinese antitrust regulators announced that NVIDIA was in violation of China’s antitrust rules for a 2020
$7B acquisition of Israeli Mellanox Technologies, a networking products supplier. China originally approved the
purchase on the condition that NVIDIA not discriminate against Chinese customers, but that condition was all
but impossible to abide in the face of previous US export bans. No penalty has yet been announced but NVIDIA’s
ﬁne can be as much as 10% of its annual (most recently completed ﬁscal year) China sales.
● The timing of the announcement raises eyebrows as it came during US-China
trade talks in Madrid. The immediate absence of any penalty to the
preliminary ruling gives China potential leverage. Interestingly enough,
Chinese antitrust authorities usually announce the ﬁne at the same time as
the ruling but may be holding back here to give trade-peace a chance.
● The decision, too, comes at the same time China has been encouraging its
domestic tech companies to not use the H20. So while, in the long term, China
hopes to wean itself off American chips, in the short-term, China still does
need NVIDIA - even though it is eager to show it does not.

Chips, Tariffs, Subsidies…oh my!
Trump has openly criticized the CHIPS Act, arguing elsewhere that all subsidies were “taxpayer handouts.”
Recently, Trump said he will be putting a “fairly substantial tariff” on semiconductor imports to incentivize
domestic chip production. Those tariffs, however, would carry exemptions for companies that agree to invest in
the US. Rather than promote onshoring chip production through allotted subsidies under the bipartisan CHIPS
Act, the administration, motivated by seeing an ROI, has used tariffs and other alternative strategies to
encourage onshoring.

US and Intel: a new, unexpected, stake-based friendship…the start of something new?
Besides tariffs, one of the new non-CHIPS strategies includes acquiring equity in chipmakers. After accusing the
newly-installed Intel CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, of being “highly-conﬂicted” because of $200M+ investments in Chinese
companies, Trump had the US Gov acquire a 10% stake in the struggling chipmaker in return for ~$8.9B of
earmarked CHIPS grants. This isn’t the ﬁrst time the US bought a stake in a company to promote national
interests (see US Steel, AIG, and GM). The move replaces the failed Intel and TSMC joint venture that Trump and
Lutnick pushed. Is this opportunism or the start of a wider US industrial policy?
● Lutnick has also ﬂirted with taking a stake in Samsung and TSMC. But the
fact that the USG is getting involved in the private sector by drawing on a
strategy normally reserved for crises is a change in precedent. Tax breaks
and subsidies, the tools the USG has normally used to focus the private
sector, may give way to a new strategy of direct investment by the USG.
Some CEOs, Republicans, and others have been rumored to have deep
concerns about the deal.
● Unexpectedly, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) agreed with Lutnick that
taxpayers should see a return from the US’s heavy investments in
domestic chip manufacturing.

TikTok USA: the “will they/won’t they” storyline comes to an end

🫡

🫡

Still, the strangest USG-private sector arrangement comes between the USG and ByteDance. In Sept., the US and
China agreed to a deal to end the years-long tease in which the US implemented but never executed a ban on
TikTok. TikTok will be allowed to operate in the US with a copy of TikTok’s recommendation algorithm sent to
Oracle. Oracle will retrain the algorithm and be responsible for data and algorithmic security. ByteDance will own
just under 20% of the new US-based company (at a total valuation of $14B) with a group of new investors,
including Oracle, owning a majority. Six of the seven board seats will be ﬁlled by Americans (TBD). The USG will
also receive an unknown multi-billion dollar fee from investors for its role in the negotiations.
● The TikTok deal sets the benchmark for data sovereignty: algorithm needs to be retrained using local data
that is protected and stored locally. The data collection issue is clearly addressed. Indeed, it is hard to see
ByteDance exﬁltrating data or inﬂuencing the US app now that it only has a minority stake.
● While not requiring congressional approval, the deal will certainly receive intense congressional scrutiny,
not least because of new free speech worries in light of the FCC-Kimmel jawboning controversy. It is the
Dept. of Treasury (speciﬁcally, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US) that will oversee and shape
Oracle’s retraining and deployment of TikTok USA and may or may not require other *ahem* “precautions.”

If you build it, the AI will come: the USG streamlining strategies for building AI infra.
The federal government’s AI Action Plan is treating AI infrastructure as a national priority, but rather than
funding construction directly, its main role is to weaken environmental regulations and expand energy supply so
private companies can accelerate data center build-out.
● This includes expediting review under the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA) and rolling back requirements in other regulations like the
Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act. DOE announced PermitAI: a
custom-built AI on NEPA ﬁlings to streamline the permitting process.
● Trump announced the upgrade/expansion of the national electrical grid,
incl. a $1B investment from Japan’s Hitachi. The USG has also been eying
an expansion of fossil fuels while rolling back clean energy subsidies.
● Fermi America, for instance, is seeking DOE loans to build the “Donald J. Trump Advanced Energy and
Intelligence Campus,” a gas and nuclear power complex in Amarillo, Texas for energizing data centers.
● Because federal policy is prioritizing fossil fuel expansion, newly built AI data centers are likely to be
locked-in to those energy sources, threatening future decarbonization efforts.

AI data center’s latest bottleneck: NIMBYism
The American public increasingly pushes back against new AI data center build outs in the latest political
ﬂashpoint. Hyperscalers’ AI aspirations may soon be capped by how well they can navigate this live wire.
● Data Center Watch: $64B in planned data center projects have been blocked or delayed amid local opposition.
● The following projects have been stalled or withdrawn due to concerns raised by nearby residents: Google’s
Project Flo in Franklin Township, Indiana; QTS and Compass’s project in Prince William County, Virginia; and
CRG’s Project Cumulus in Saint Charles, Missouri.
● Farmers emerge as one of the leading factions, driven largely
by environmental concerns and competition for resources
(land, water, and power). Other residents raise concerns over
light pollution, air quality, and noise levels.
● Growing domestic opposition could force American
hyperscalers to offshore more clusters. This threatens the ﬂow
of spending that has buoyed the greater US economy.
However, these clusters do challenge the livelihoods of many
Americans, something hyperscalers have yet to reconcile.

Foundational AI Research is a government priority, but where’s the money?
The AI Action Plan mentions the need to fund “basic science” in AI, but “core” AI R&D is far below the $32B that
experts have recommended the US invest by ‘26. This is foundational, non-commercial research - the type of
research that is sometimes argued to be more transformative than that of the private sector.
● In ‘21, the Eric Schmidt-led National Security Commission on AI issued a
report that called for annual federal funding for non-military AI R&D to
reach $32B by ‘26. The Bipartisan Senate AI Working Group published an
“AI Roadmap” (May ‘24) that echoed the same $32B price tag.
● In ‘25, Trump’s proposed budget allotted $3.316B for non-defense AI R&D
spending with $1.95B for “core” AI R&D. In general, total federal AI
non-military R&D spending has hovered around $3B since ‘23.
● It is unclear if foundational AI research will increase. The administration
has freezed funds from universities and the NSF to ensure compliance with new priorities.
● The US’s NAIRR, the shared national infrastructure for AI research and education, will move from a pilot
program to a coordinated national program in the coming year, however. The $2.6B price tag associated with
the project is split among different federal agencies and companies.

AI regulation across the U.S. states: winners and losers
State lawmakers were busy debating AI legislation this past year with more than 1,080 (!) “AI-related” bills
introduced across the states with 118 becoming law. The ﬁve states that had the most AI legislation introduced
were New York, Illinois, California, Maryland, and Texas. Current state laws that are most likely to pass typically fall
under one of the following categories:
● AI-generated child sexual abuse material (CSAM)/non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII) bans: laws
prohibiting the creation and dissemination of AI-generated child pornography or non-consensual sexually
explicit photos of adults; creating takedown rules for online platforms.
● Transparency & disclosure requirements: laws requiring companies to disclose when a customer is
interacting with AI (especially chatbots or generative AI) or to label AI-generated content with visible
notices/metadata.
● Government AI use restrictions: laws that restrict how state government agencies can use AI, especially for
surveillance, law enforcement or government decision-making.
● Health & Employment: speciﬁcally, laws requiring the disclosure that an AI was used in doctor/patient
interactions or employer/job candidate decisions and requiring human oversight, in some cases.

Winner: California’s SB53 (“Transparency in Frontier Act”)
The ﬁrst state law requiring public, standardized safety disclosures from large AI developers was signed into law
in Sept. Last year, CA State Senator Scott Wiener tried his hand in passing an aggressive AI safety bill (i.e.
SB1047) only to face pushback from industry leaders, celebrated AI scientists, and Governor Newsom, who, in the
end, vetoed the bill. Newsom convened an AI expert working group that included Wiener, and the group’s
recommendations formed the backbone of SB53. Modest as the law is (it applies only to the largest developers
and accounts primarily for signiﬁcant harms), it will set the national standard for AI transparency requirements.
● The law will apply only to large frontier model developers (10^26 FLOPS
and >$500M in revenue). These developers will need to make available
safety and security protocols on their websites and issue public risk
assessment results any time they release or update a new frontier model.
Importantly, developers need to notify state authorities of critical safety
incidents or threats of imminent danger. Whistleblower protections are
also included in the legislation.
● Other states are taking note: both Michigan and New York are
considering similar transparency requirements for large developers with
stateof.ai 2025
New York’s law awaiting signature from Gov. Kathy Hochul.

Loser: omnibus AI laws winnow down and third party auditing a no-go for now
Despite SB53’s passage, state governance laws that apply across different sectors and impose safety obligations
on private sector entities are few and far between. Other previously enacted AI governance laws were revised and
narrowed over the last year out of renewed fears that the regulation might be too onerous. Attempts to include
third party auditing requirements across state laws like SB53 were resisted and the requirement dropped in
most cases.
● Gov Youngkin (Virginia) vetoed state AI governance legislation (HB2094)
because the legislation would place burdens on the AI industry. The
Connecticut Gov also said he would veto AI legislation for the same reason.
● Texas passed the Responsible AI Governance Act (TRAIGA), but it was
amended during committee discussions to remove obligations like: “duty of
care,” impact assessments, and high-risk AI system disclosures.
● Utah passed new amendments to its Utah AI Policy Act (UAIPA) that
narrowed key legal requirements to apply only to high-risk GenAI systems.
● Colorado delayed implementation of its AI Act-modeled “Colorado AI Act”
until June ‘26 with amendments being debated by the state legislature.

The State of State AI Regulation is a “patchwork” problem
The Trump administration pushed for a state AI moratorium in part because it believed that state AI legislation
was too uneven and confusing to be effective. Some states have been more active than others in regulating AI. Of
course, AI companies are not happy. A receptive Trump administration has encouraged the biggest developers
and investors to take a staunch anti-state legislation stance. It is not about what kinds of laws states should pass
but whether state legislatures should be passing any AI legislation to begin with.
● In submissions to Trump’s AI Action Plan, OpenAI, Meta, and
Google all called for the preemption of state AI laws to free them
of liability for nearly all state AI legislation. VC ﬁrm Andreessen
Horowitz argued that AI state laws could be considered
unconstitutional under the interstate commerce clause.
● But the show goes on and companies face a trio of choices to
manage the “patchwork”: 1) structure compliance according to the
most stringent legislative frameworks (like the Colorado AI Act) 2)
fragment compliance state by state 3) lobby and wait for federal
action that may never come.

But the Big, Beautiful ﬁght over AI preemption continues…in the sandbox
Trump’s landmark One Big Beautiful Bill (now a federal spending statute) initially contained a preemption clause
that conditioned state broadband funds on the implementation of a 10-year moratorium on state and local AI
regulations. The controversial provision was struck down before the bill’s ﬁnal passage. But the idea lives.
Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), the moratorium lead, introduced a regulatory sandbox bill (SANDBOX Act) that would
permit companies to apply for waivers from “obstructive legislation” for up to 10 years.
● Despite being close to implementation, the provision was unpopular from the
start with unlikely bedfellows joining in bipartisan condemnation. Indeed, the
provision was only removed because Senator Blackburn (R-TN) was worried
about child safety and removing recent Tennessee-passed copyright
protections for artists (see ELVIS Act).
● Anthropic lobbied Congress, arguing that streamlined federal regulation
should be established before preempting state/local oversight. Labs appear to
prefer light-touch federal regulation over no regulation, but the latter may be
preferred over a patchwork of state laws. The number of state bills in motion is
often overstated; in truth, the IAPP estimates that only ~40 bills (of the over 1k
stateof.ai 2025
introduced) may signiﬁcantly impact American AI labs.

Regulatory sandboxes: innovation boost or waiver machine?
The U.S. “SANDBOX Act” would create a federal AI sandbox run by the Ofﬁce of Science and Technology Policy
that grants time-limited waivers from existing rules. Firms could receive two-year waivers, renewable up to ﬁve
times (max 10 years), with “auto-approval” if an agency doesn’t respond in 90 days and an appeal path to OSTP.
Critics say this risks weakening enforcement, while supporters say it accelerates learning-by-doing.
● What’s new in the U.S. bill: Centralized sandboxing at OSTP with
participating agencies (e.g., FTC) reviewing, but non-response means
approval. Denials can be appealed to OSTP.
● How it differs from the EU: EU AI Act mandates regulator-led sandboxes
focused on risk mitigation and proof-of-compliance, not multi-year
waivers from rules.
● Pros: Early, supervised deployments, faster feedback loops for regulators,
and visibility into frontier systems before scale. ￼
● Cons: Incentives for forum shopping and regulatory capture, uneven
protections, could function as de-facto deregulatory waivers if
“auto-approval” becomes common.

Kenya, South Korea, Singapore, the UK, and the US gathered in San Francisco to announce the International
Network of AI Safety Institutes. Almost a year later and the network has met twice with the US a no-show.
● Its purpose was to create a global network of publicly funded government
agencies that would meet regularly to develop best practices and share
research for monitoring and reporting harms, risks, and incidents.
● The network has met twice in ‘25 for joint testing exercises evaluating the
risks of agentic systems. The US did not appear at either meeting.

The “AI-Washing” problem: the year in federal enforcement
Federal agencies like the DOJ, FTC, and SEC have largely assumed the AI regulatory oversight role. Their main priority is in
making sure that companies do not overstate their AI claims (“AI-Washing”).

● One of the more infamous cases brought by the DOJ over the last year was an
indictment against Albert Saniger, former CEO and founder of “nate,” for
making false claims of integrating AI to raise $40M< from investors. In truth,
nate’s “AI” capabilities were an outsourced team of Filipino workers.
● DOJ has amended its internal guidance: if a committed crime is made worse
by AI, the DOJ will request a harsher sentence.
● FTC has brought several actions against AI companies. A number of these
involve companies making false claims about their products or services (i.e.
Workado, DoNotPay, Cleo AI, and Evolv Technologies).
● SEC, meanwhile, has created a Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit (CETU),
which is a 30-person task force to detect fraud in AI/ML tech companies.
● SEC has been looking closely at AI related disclosures made in public ﬁlings
and in letters to stakeholders to look out for potential “AI-Washing.”

The reverse acqui-hire: the Valley’s fast-track exit
Big Tech’s expected M&A “Trump Bump” has yet to arrive as antitrust scrutiny under Biden chilled buyers.
Instead, Big Tech has embraced reverse acqui-hires: deals that onboard talent in weeks, avoid acquisition rules,
and leave hollowed-out “RemainCos” to pivot into smaller markets.

● Reverse acqui-hires surged in 2025, with Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and
Meta leading deals (e.g., Microsoft/Inﬂection, Google/Character.AI,
Amazon/Adept, Meta/Scale AI).
● Their typical structure consists of (1) generous founder/staff payouts, (2)
IP licensing to make investors whole, (3) a slimmed-down RemainCo
shifting to niche B2B.
○ Inﬂection AI → Microsoft: from $4B AI contender to 12ppl “AI Studio.”
○ Adept → Amazon: $1B agentic AI startup reduced to a small
enterprise AI team.
○ Scale AI → Meta: once 1,400 employees, cut staff/pods, now a single
B2B “Demand Generation” focus.

But the FTC may be cracking down as it pursues investigations
Regulators are signaling growing discomfort with reverse acqui-hires, even though they evade formal M&A
review. Lina Khan opened an investigation into Microsoft’s Inﬂection deal in 2024, and by March 2025 new FTC
Chair Andrew Ferguson was demanding more disclosures on Microsoft’s AI operations.
● In July ‘24 the FTC requested details from Amazon on its reverse acqui-hire of Adept after Senators Wyden,
Welch and Warren signed a letter urging an investigation.
● Meanwhile, the UK’s own competition authority cleared the Microsoft/Inﬂection AI deal in ‘24 saying they
do not see a “realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition.”
● While no action has been taken, the FTC’s signals suggest reverse acqui-hires could yet be treated as
acquisitions, putting Big Tech’s favorite exit path under threat.

Figma’s IPO: Lina Khan…vindicated?
The FTC and DOJ challenged fourteen startup acquisitions between 2020 and 2023 whereas in the seven years
prior (2012-2019), the two agencies challenged only three. Both Khan and DOJ Antitrust Chief Jonathan Kanter
operated under the theory that Big Tech choked the startup ecosystem by acquiring startups with the intent of
killing competition. Silicon Valley scoffed at the theory, but Figma’s strong IPO may validate the thinking.
● Adobe sought to acquire Figma for $20B in 2022 but after 15 months of
antitrust scrutiny, the two saw no path toward regulatory approval. Figma
pursued an IPO on July 31, 2025, instead. At the end of Figma’s debut, the
company was worth close to $57B after the stock tripled during trading
hours. Figma’s stock price has since dropped from that ﬁrst-day high, but
investors still view it as a solid public grade tech company.
● Wiz, too, was considering an IPO before agreeing to an acquisition
by Alphabet in the weeks following Trump’s inauguration. Wiz

concerns + IPO dreams. Does Wiz now have seller’s remorse?

having lost not one, but two (!) major antitrust suits over the last year. Current DOJ Antitrust Chief Abigail Slater
is far from a friend for the Valley but she could face pressure to approve the mega-purchase.

● DOJ Antitrust Chief Slater during the Google antitrust case: “In a time of political
division in our nation, the case against Google brings everyone together.”
● The DOJ in July, however, approved three mergers worth $63B in just one week and
there are reports that Slater is being pressured to be more “deal-friendly” towards
incoming transactions and acquisitions.
● But the timing of Alphabet’s largest acquisition could not be worst as the company is attempting a vertical
merger, a deal more prone to regulatory disapproval, when it is under intense federal scrutiny. Alphabet
agreed to pay $3.2B (10% of the deal) to Wiz if the transaction is not approved - not exactly a sign of
diminished conﬁdence. The deal, if it goes through, would essentially be a greenlight for tech to return to
buying startups through traditional acquisitions.

Google comes out unscathed in 1 of 2 antitrust cases but search is on the ropes…
The Silicon Valley darling has been bruised, battered, and, ultimately, trust-busted over the year in two landmark
antitrust case rulings. Judges in two separate cases ruled that Google was operating a monopoly over 1) search
2) ad tech. Remedies were issued early Sept. ‘25 in the search monopoly case where the court, pointing to the
vulnerability of Google’s search business to LLM chatbots, largely agreed with Google’s proposed remedies. It was
a big win for Google given the heat the company is taking from ChatGPT and other agents that disintermediate
Google.com
● Google must now share search index data with competitors like DuckDuckGo and
can no longer make exclusive contracts with other companies to feature Google
Search and other products. Google can still pay partners to feature Google search
and other apps. So while Google paid Apple $20B for exclusive use of Google
search on Safari, that deal can remain so long as the terms are non-exclusive.
● These are light-touch compared to the “structural remedies” the USG proposed,
which included forcing Google to sell its Chrome browser.
● Google will likely appeal and ﬁght against the initial “monopoly” branding, but
there’s also the “ad tech” case where, experts caution, Google is more likely to be
stateof.ai 2025
forced to part with core parts of its ad business.

Meanwhile in Europe…
Pressure has mounted for the EU to abandon its landmark AI Act, but the Commission has trudged on with the
regulation using the following phased compliance schedule:
August 1, 2024

The AI Act’s compliance countdown ofﬁcially begins; law is on the books (i.e. the Ofﬁcial
Journal of the European Union) but its key obligations are not yet in effect.

February 2, 2025

The ﬁrst major obligation goes into effect: a ban on “unacceptable” AI risk systems (e.g.
social scoring, biometric identiﬁcation, facial recognition)

August 2, 2025

The voluntary Code of Practice for GPAI is released; ﬁrms that choose to follow the Code of
Practice have presumed compliance with the AI Act. Those that don’t are subject to the AI
Act’s Chapter V rules for GPAI models.

August 2, 2026

Remaining obligations for AI systems (except for “high-risk” AI systems) goes into effect.

August 2, 2027

Obligations for “high-risk” AI systems go into effect.

The GPAI Codes of Practice…and so it begins.
On August 2, 2025, the GPAI Codes of Practice went into effect after a three month delay. The “Codes” are one of
the ﬁrst major steps of the AI Act’s implementation. For providers of general-purpose AI (GPAI) models, the AI Act
requires companies to develop frameworks to show how they would fulﬁll requirements concerning 1)
transparency 2) copyright and 3) safety and security (this category only applies to frontier GPAI models posing
systemic risk). The “Codes” are a voluntary framework, an option for companies that would rather not develop
their own guidance to fulﬁll the stated GPAI obligations, which began August 2, 2025. EU enforcement of the
obligations, however, does not begin until August ‘26. The AI Act also has a 2-year grace period for models
released before August 2, 2025.
● Amazon, Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and others have signed all three chapters of the “Codes.”
● xAI has agreed to sign the third chapter (“Safety and Security”) but has not signed the chapters on
“Transparency” and “Copyright,” which makes the company responsible for developing its own policy that
meets the AI Act’s requirements for transparency and copyright compliance.
● Meta has refused to sign the Code of Practice saying, “This Code introduces a number of legal uncertainties
for model developers, as well as measures which go far beyond the scope of the AI Act.”

So, who’s afraid of the AI Act? 😓😓
Needless to say, companies, both in the EU and abroad, are not happy with the AI Act’s rollout. The EU’s delayed
implementation is not exactly inspiring conﬁdence. Each member state was required to assign national
authorities to oversee the AI Act’s implementation but so far only 3 member states have fully completed the
requirement. The AI Act also called for the creation of technical standards by April ‘25 to address the “how” of
compliance. But as of this writing, those standards are still in development. A coalition of EU AI companies signed
a letter in July calling for a 2-year “stop clock” on the AI Act with Sweden’s PM publicly calling the AI Act
“confusing” and President Macron saying “we are over regulating.” But the show goes on…for now.
● In Sept., the EC opened a “digital simpliﬁcation omnibus,” a
commission that would look and review all of the EU’s digital
laws, including the AI Act, to simplify its digital rules. In general,
the EC announced that it wants to “reduce administrative
burdens” by 25% across the regulatory board.
● The calls for a “pause” on the AI Act grow louder by the day,
however. Despite the pressure, the EC has said that it would not
delay implementation deadlines.

Is the EU doing enough to catch up in the AI race?
Europe is trying to shift from rulemaking to capacity-building, but the gap keeps widening. Over 50 years, the
region minted no tech ﬁrm above $400B in value, while the U.S. now has seven at $1T+. In 2024, U.S. labs
shipped ~40 major models, China ~15, and the EU ~3. Brussels is setting aside billions to amplify its spending,
but is that the scale or speed the problem demands?
● In 2024, Mario Draghi, the former European Central Bank President,
issued a report on “European Competitiveness,” whose
recommendations the EU agreed to implement. Draghi pointed to
multiple structural challenges including market fragmentation,
regulatory barriers, demographic decline, low productivity, and
risk-averse capital deployment as reasons for EU’s stagnation.
● Draghi put the cost of his modern-day Marshall Plan at €800B per
year (!). While the EU has increased spending, most notably
launching InvestAI (an >€200B AI investment fund), it is not taking
that price tag seriously. One estimate said that only about 11% of
Draghi’s recommendations were seen through so far…

*Chart shows private investment only. Including China's estimated $56B in
government AI funding (2025), total Chinese investment signiﬁcantly
exceeds Europe's.

Cheerio, Bletchley, and ‘ello “growth zones!”: Starmer to “mainline AI into the UK’s veins”
Since January, the UK has shifted from convening global AI safety to an industrial push. The AI Opportunities
Action Plan prioritizes investment, data-centre capacity, and light-touch rules, with designated “growth zones” to
fast-track permits. The government frames this as a route to a potential ~$740B GDP boost by 2035.
● Announced actions include increasing compute 20x by 2030 and
growth zones for data centers with streamlined planning.
● Starmer has committed to adopting 50 recommendations from ex-AI
adviser Matt Clifford and to avoid new rules that could slow
deployment. But government bureaucracy has made
operationalizing these large-scale ambitions a slog.
● Ministers claim AGI is around the corner but compute investments
remain well below that of the US while AISI relies on voluntary
agreements with labs to test models pre-deployment.
● The country’s strategic tone now mirrors the US: pro-adoption, state-backed
capacity, rebranded “AI safety” bodies focused on capability evals and
deployment, and delaying safety legislation to an undetermined date.

The CCP’s Action Plan: an AI World Tour
Three days after Trump announced the AI Action Plan, China released their own Global AI Governance Action
Plan. Coincidence? We think not. China’s deliberately contrasting ambitions, which are no less zealous, emphasize
strategies of “multilateral collaboration” and “diplomatic engagement.” In practice, these buzzwords denote
China’s plan to supply the Global South with its own AI solutions and to draw on its inﬂuence among developing
countries, especially in Africa, to impact the UN and other international bodies.
● China has proposed setting up a new World AI Cooperation Organization
and is working with the UN’s Pact for the Future and Global Digital
Compact to build out processes for AI development and governance.
● China appears to be applying the US TikTok playbook with authorities ﬁrst
cautioning and then instructing companies to stop buying NVIDIA chips
for fear of the US threatening the country’s national security.
● The Belt and Road Initiative, the Global Development Initiative, and the
Global Security Initiative continue to be key components of China’s global

China’s AI Regulations also begin to take effect
The world’s most active AI regulator continues to issue AI standards and regulations. Here are a few of the
highlights of China’s most signiﬁcant regulations from the past year:
● Administrative Measures for the labeling of AI-generated content: In effect September 1, 2025, this obligates
content service providers to clearly label AI-generated content. Chatbots, AI-generated writing and video
creation all require customer-facing labels denoting the AI as such. Some AI-generated content, however,
may only require hidden labeling within the metadata.
● Three National Cybersecurity Standards: In April 2025, the State Administration for Market Regulation and
the Standardization Administration of China released three separated standards outlining security
requirements for datasets, data-labeling, and, in general, generative AI services. The requirements take effect
November 2025.
● The AI-Plus Plan: The State Council of China released a set of industrial policy goals that all aim to have AI
capabilities fully integrated across the entire Chinese economy with complete AI penetration across all
Chinese sectors by 2035.

China aims to achieve tech self-reliance…no matter the ¥¥¥¥
China’s strategy for AI self-reliance gained ground over the last year with news-making achievements from open
source leaders like DeepSeek, MoonShot AI, and others. During an April 2025 Politburo meeting, President Xi
Jinping signaled all hands were on deck and told ministers to “redouble our efforts” on AI. This shows China’s
intent on achieving self-sufﬁciency, a perennial aim that always intensiﬁes whenever it enters a trade war with
the US. But mounting debt levels may pose problems down the line.
● Rising debt among countries is not new, but the problem is
pronounced in China where the country accounts for “more than half
of the increase in the global economy’s debt-to-GDP ratio since
2008.” IMF in a 2025 report suggested it’s unstable.
● This is largely due to national ambitions that push for high annual
GDP growth, forcing local governments to invest in dubious assets.
● But AI spending is not slowing down with the CCP allocating a 10%
increase in science and tech spending from 2024. Winning the AI
race, then, isn’t just a political imperative but potentially vital to the
long-term health of the Chinese economy.

US defense sizes up its bet on AI-ﬁrst systems and opens to up to frontier AI labs
2025 marked a decisive step change in how the US and its allies procure and deploy AI in defense. Rather than
fragmented pilot projects, defense leaders consolidated billions into enterprise-scale AI platforms while also
opening the door to frontier model providers. NATO fast-tracked its ﬁrst alliance-wide AI system, Palantir’s
Maven Smart System, as a central pillar of the Western defense industrial base.
● US Army signed a 10-year enterprise contract with Palantir worth up to
$10B, consolidating dozens of prior software deals into one platform.
● Project Maven expanded to $1.3B through 2029, now supporting 20,000+
individual warﬁghters, double the base earlier in the year.
● NATO procured Palantir’s Maven Smart System in just six months for all
members despite feeling frosty with loosening US security guarantees.
● DoD signed $200M ceiling contracts with each of OpenAI, Anthropic,
Google, and xAI to explore frontier AI for command, cyber, and planning
missions. This marked quite a vibe shift for AI groups that previously took
a strong view that their models should not be used for defense purposes.

Autonomy takes ﬂight with drone wingmen entering the doctrine
The U.S. has moved from DARPA’s AlphaDogﬁght in 2020 and live AI-ﬂown F-16 tests in 2022 to embedding
autonomy into doctrine. Collaborative drones, swarming initiatives, and multi-domain contracts are now framed
as essential to offset China’s numerical advantage, making uncrewed systems a core pillar of force design.
● Air Force’s Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) ﬁrst prototypes (General

Europe into treating AI as a frontline capability. Capitals are writing autonomy into plans, Brussels is mobilizing
massive rearmament funds, and both startups and primes are surging to build sovereign AI defense.
● EU’s Readiness 2030 (fka ReArm Europe) authorizes up to €650B extra defense
spend, naming AI, drones, and counter-drone as critical gaps. A new SAFE fund
will pool EU money to de-risk cross-border projects in autonomy, cyber, and
electronic warfare. Critics warn hardware may only arrive after 2030 unless AI is
prioritized as a force multiplier now.
● The UK’s Strategic Defence Review 2025 makes AI and autonomy a priority,

While some argue AI is not shaking up the labor market yet
A joint study from the Yale Budget Lab and Brooking Institution found that current labor market changes precede
the introduction of ChatGPT in 2022. The authors conclude that there’s little reason to think that “AI automation is
currently eroding the demand for cognitive labor across the economy” and caution against predicting job losses
based on “AI-exposure” data alone.
● They focus on “occupational mix,” a macro measurement of job movement
among workers, i.e. switching/starting/losing a job.
● Currently, the “occupational mix” for AI is tracking with that of other tech
breakthroughs like the introduction of the internet and computers. If that
trend continues, an AI-induced labor disruption will take decades to
materialize, not months.
● The study’s results, however, do not contradict the sector-speciﬁc Stanford
study (see previous slide). There is an uptick in “occupational mix
dissimilarity” among new grads in recent months but the dissimilarity
tracks with pre-2022 trends, suggesting non-AI factors.

Both Anthropic and OpenAI released data on how its users were using their respective models. Use cases varied
across country and US state. For instance, California users were the most likely to use AI for coding while DC usage
centered around job search activities and writing projects. For work-oriented tasks, ChatGPT was often used for
writing-related tasks while Claude was often used for coding tasks. As a result, the conclusions drawn from each
of the studies for the future of work were different. OpenAI argued that its data shows AI being used mainly to
augment work-related functions and offer “decision support” while Anthropic argued that enterprises, speciﬁcally,

The global AI talent wars: who’s winning on immigration and retention?
The US’s AI Action Plan excluded immigration strategies for retaining foreign AI talent even while two of Trump’s
top AI advisors are foreign-born (David Sacks and Sriram Krishnan). But countries across the world have been
enticing foreign workers with streamlined visa processing, housing subsidies, and general ﬂexibility around their
work arrangements. The US still remains, far and above, the preferred place for top-notch AI research. But as the
US continues to cultivate a reputation as a less-than-friendly home to foreign-born talent, other countries are
taking advantage, especially China.

China could be getting better at retaining talent: the overlooked lesson from DeepSeek
A deeper dive into DeepSeek’s demographics signal that China is gradually improving its ability to train and
retain its scientists, a warning for the U.S. which has grown dependent on Chinese AI researchers.
● A Stanford report by Dr. Amy Zegart looking at 201 DeepSeek authors found that 55% of the them were
trained and based entirely in China, without any U.S. afﬁliation. Only 24% of the DeepSeek authors had a
US afﬁliation at some point, with most staying just one year.
● In May, State Sec. Marco Rubio announced the revocation of Chinese student visas for those with
“connections to the CCP or studying in critical ﬁelds,” potentially accelerating China’s strategy to retain and
poach AI talent. For reference, the DOJ’s “China Initiative” (2018), an enforcement program to track and
prosecute Chinese nationals sharing trade secrets with the CCP, increased China-born researcher
departures from U.S. labs by 50%, greatly accelerating reverse migration.
● In February ‘25, a federal grand jury charged Leon Ding, a former Google employee and Chinese national,
with economic espionage and trade secret theft for plans to steal info related to Google AI’s chips and
software platform and use it to sell products for two CCP afﬁliated tech companies.
● Meanwhile, half of the researchers reporting to Alexander Wang in Meta’s Superintelligence Lab received
their undergrad degrees in China, posing major issues if talent decoupling worsens.

While Europe tries its best to compete for AI talent…
The EU and UK have also been trying to capitalize on the US brain drain. But while the EU may be able to attract
a few AI researchers here and there, its biggest hurdle is, in the end, the most straightforward: money. Top AI
talent wants to be compensated. The US is still the best place for getting paid.
● 22% of the world’s leading AI researchers studied in Europe, but only
14% continue to work in the EU.
● EU wage growth for AI has grown only very modestly compared to the
US. In ‘23 salaries for software developers in the US were 2x-4x higher
than they were for those in Europe.
● While relative inﬂows (see charts) show modest growth for some EU
countries, in absolute terms the differences are starker with the US
attracting more talent, on average, than its EU peers.
● EU + UK have implemented a number of programs to attract and retain
AI talent (e.g. new visas, funds/fellowships to attract researchers), but in
the face of astronomical investment in AI elsewhere in the world, it is
unlikely to be enough to increase the region’s share of AI talent.

Deepfakes and 2024 elections: emerging threat or outreach tool?
Despite rampant worries of AI-generated election dis/misinformation during the “largest election year in global

deceptive uses of AI, while present, were still quite limited and there were surprising positive use cases. Both
India and the US saw the most AI uses in their elections. Experts caution that the AI dis/misinformation threat is

● While there were instances of deepfakes being used to
intentionally deceive voters, in general, deceptively fake
audio and video of political candidates had little to no
impact on voting outcomes. Deepfakes were often used to
amplify a party’s messaging, excite its base, and deepen
existing political divides. Candidates sometimes used “AI” to

● Singapore: Gov launches its AIBots platform where any Singapore public servant
can create and deploy an AIBot and train it on agency data and use it both to
communicate with constituents and complete interagency work.
● US: GenAI use cases jumped from 32 in ‘23 to 282 in ‘24 with an overwhelming
number of use cases coming from the Department of Health and Human
Services (mostly for data analysis and management).
● China: Local governments have tried integrating DeepSeek in day-to-day work
and interactions with constituents; ﬁrst half of ‘24 saw 81 gov procurement
contracts for LLMs for use in public projects.
● UK: Government Digital Services (GDS) does a trial run of AI coding assistants.
● EU: Launches ApplyAI Strategy, announces GenAI pilot projects for use by public
agencies.

GovGPT: politicians awkwardly start using AI
Politicians have come around to GenAI use but constituencies are not pleased. The Swedish Prime Minister, for
instance, admitted to consulting AI tools in his day-to-day only to have protesters shouting “we didn’t vote for
ChatGPT!” Politicians will need to balance the use of AI tools with public concerns that their elected leaders are
tech-sourcing their governance duties.
● One British MP, Mark Sewards, accomplished the inevitable and
created an AI clone of himself to create a full-service bot (“AI
Mark”). Constituents can interact with the chatbot any time, asking
policy questions, raising issues, or writing angry letters.
● In a mostly symbolic (and potentially illegal) move, Albania’s PM
formally appointed an AI minister named Diella to oversee the
country’s public procurement processes and reduce corruption.
Diella even made an address to Albania’s parliament.
● The clearest use of AI among politicians is in speechmaking with a
notable rise in ChatGPT’s preferred vocabulary in Britain’s House
of Commons over the last few years (“I rise!”).

AI safety commitments: a changing of the tides?
Following a reversal in messaging around safety-relevant AI topics from the current US administration and
growing international/commercial competition amongst labs, certain safety protocols have been deprioritized.
● First, xAI missed its self-imposed deadline to implement a safety framework it proposed at the AI Seoul
Summit in Feb. Anthropic backpedaled on promises to fully deﬁne ASL-4 safety standards before releasing an
ASL-3 model (Claude Opus 4). GDM released Gemini 2.5 Pro but waited 3 months to publish an accompanying
model card, violating the spirit of prior commitments. Lastly, OpenAI seems to have quietly abandoned
protocols to test the most dangerous possible versions of its models (task-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuned variants).
● While Trump’s team has consistently recognized many
extreme AI risks, the overall shift in tone de-legitimizes
aspects of the AI Safety community.
● The industry and policy focus is now clearly on ensuring
American dominance in the AI race. These themes echo
throughout the recent moves of AI labs, who seem to
gravitate closer to speed over precaution, often in
competition with other US labs.

AI labs spend more in a day than AI safety science organizations spend in a year
Leading external AI safety organizations rely on budgets that lag far behind the AI labs they hope to support. As
a result, the ﬁeld’s best talent remains densest within the major lab’s internal safety teams.
● We estimate the eleven most prominent American AI safety-science organizations combined will spend just
$133.4M in 2025. This grouping includes the following organizations: CAISI, METR, CAIS, FAR.AI, Haize Labs,
Palisade Research, Virtue AI, Gray Swan, Redwood Research, Irregular, and the Frontier Model Forum.
● Although well-resourced, internal safety teams ultimately
answer to the same organizations racing to commercialize
frontier models. This creates a structural conﬂict of interest:
ﬁndings that call for caution may be deprioritized in favor of
speed and market advantage.
● This isn’t (just) about money: external orgs also lack other
means to attract talent like comparable prestige, and access
to privileged information / pre-release models. As such it is
difﬁcult for them to provide a credible counterweight,
leaving the ecosystem over-reliant on self-policing.

The State of AI Incidents
The AI Incident Database (AIID), a community-supported website to track incidents of AI in the real world, shows
incremental jumps since 2023. Reported estimates likely underestimate the true extent of AI-enabled harms.
● Reported incidents continue to be dominated by harms involving “Malicious Actors.” These generally involve
cyber attacks or fraudulent schemes. Since incidents can be added to AIID years after they occur, ﬁnal annual

● Reporting gaps also exist. Incidents can be Trends in AI incidents

are becoming less innocuous over time (plagiarism and hallucinations → cyber attacks and weapon creation).
● OpenAI has shared multiple reports detailing the disruption of

actors attempted to leverage OpenAI’s models during illicit
activities like child exploitation, covert inﬂuence operations,
malicious cyber activity, social engineering, cyber espionage,
propaganda generation, and credential harvesting.

Cyber capabilities (and risks) accelerate
AI agents are poised to signiﬁcantly challenge cybersecurity defenses. METR research shows that AI task
completion capabilities double every 7 months across general domains, but one researcher's replication
estimated that, for offensive cybersecurity, these abilities are doubling even faster: every 5 months.
● Current models can reliably handle cyber security tasks that take
humans about 40-50% about 50% of the time.
● Since 2019, long-horizon task solving has doubled every ~7 months.
● A researcher applied METR's methodology to offensive cyber
security benchmarks and found a 5-month doubling time, with
current models solving 6-minute cyber tasks at 50% success rates.
● Two notable recent benchmarks assess this:
○ CyberGym tests agents on reproducing 1,507 real software vulnerabilities, with the best systems
achieving only 11.9% success at recreating known security ﬂaws, (though agents unexpectedly
discovered 15 previously unknown vulnerabilities), and
○ BountyBench tests agents on 25 real-world systems with actual bug bounties, ﬁnding agents are better
at ﬁxing security problems (90% success) than exploiting them (32.5-67.5% success).

The rise of “vibe hacking”...
Threat actors now deploy AI for all stages of fraud operations. Criminals recently used Claude Code to
orchestrate attacks against 17+ organizations, while North Korean operatives leveraged Claude to inﬁltrate
Fortune 500 companies. This is a fundamental shift: AI-assisted attacks can now handle complex technical tasks
that previously required teams of skilled operators, dramatically lowering barriers to sophisticated cybercrime.
● Rather than being used for speciﬁc, difﬁcult tasks, Claude was used
throughout development. Their report describes how Claude Code was used
to inﬁltrate networks, analyze stolen ﬁnancial data to calculate "optimal"
ransom amounts, and generate psychologically targeted extortion notes.
● In another case, North Korean operators with minimal technical skills
leveraged Claude to pass technical interviews at Fortune 500 tech
companies and maintain engineering positions. These salaries directly fund
North Korea's government and military programs.
● These examples demonstrate how AI has removed traditional barriers to
creating dangerous malware.

high-risk despite not having conclusive evidence. Both adopted a precautionary approach: multi-layered

Concerning model demos rattle the public…
Examples of misalignment, often uncovered in experimental settings, continue to gain visibility in mainstream
news cycles. While these ﬁndings highlight alignment failures, they are often misrepresented by the media.
● Research has observed behaviors ranging from true misalignment (alignment
faking) to concerning capabilities that aren't necessarily misaligned (evaluation
awareness, blackmail attempts that may reﬂect misguided helpfulness).
● Coverage of these demos has attracted considerable attention, but can
misrepresent ﬁndings. For example, GDM researchers demonstrated that
apparent ‘self-preservation’ behaviors disappear with simple prompt
clariﬁcations, suggesting these systems lack genuine self-preservation drives
and are merely trying to complete tasks.
● The purpose of these exercises remains to identify points of alignment fragility.
Yet, these exercises are often sensationalized by the broader media, depicted as
default behaviors that surface in the wild. Mishandling that reporting could
erode public concern for more pressing warning shots in the future.

…but the ﬁeld of interpretability sees strong momentum
This past year, interpretability teams unlocked new methods to trace circuits in language models, shifting the
focus from features to bundles of features that interact with one another during processing.
● Using cross-layer transcoders (CLT), Anthropic crafted a preliminary “microscope”
that unveils the internal processes of a model, pinpointing activation pathways
that are causally responsible for speciﬁc model behaviors. Moving beyond
Sparse Autoencoders (SAE), teams can now investigate internals at a higher
abstraction layer, shedding light on actual reasoning patterns.
● This work was later replicated by Goodﬁre, an organization purely dedicated to
the ﬁeld of interpretability. Goodﬁre’s recent $50M Series A round, which
included Anthropic, marks the appetite for a sustained focus on this domain.
● More complex methods aren’t always better, though – Google DeepMind found
that linear probes consistently outperformed SAEs at detecting harmful intent
both in-distribution and out-of-distribution, contradicting the hypothesis that
sparse SAE features generalize better than dense probes.

Blufﬁng machines: how hallucinations are made
Current benchmarks perpetuate hallucination by rewarding conﬁdent guessing over "I don't know". OpenAI
researchers propose a mitigation to this that would require modifying existing evaluations to include explicit
conﬁdence thresholds.
● Hallucinations emerge from pretraining: models
successfully learn patterns with high statistical regularity
that converge with scale, but they inevitably hallucinate
on arbitrary low-frequency facts (like birthdays).
● Post-training doesn’t succeed in ﬁxing these errors because evaluations are not aligned. Most benchmarks use
binary scoring that penalizes abstention. When saying "I don't know" scores 0 but guessing might score 1, the
optimal strategy is always to guess conﬁdently.
● Rather than adding new hallucination tests, the authors advocate for the modiﬁcation of existing mainstream
evaluations to include explicit conﬁdence thresholds in instructions and discourage guessing. Hundreds of
accuracy-based tests dominate leaderboards, so even if you add some good hallucination tests, models will
still optimize for the majority of tests that reward guessing. They argue that hallucination discouragement
should be baked in.

Until hallucinations disappear, can we detect them in real time?
Token-level hallucination detection is far more helpful than broad hallucination classiﬁcation of overall responses
(consider a response that says “The Eiffel Tower is in Paris and is made of rubber”.) Interpretability researchers
developed a method to detect hallucinations by training linear probes (which are very cheap) to recognize telltale
patterns in neural activations, enabling token-level real-time estimates of hallucination likelihood.
● The probes detect fabricated names/dates/citations in
long-form text with ~70% recall at 10% false positive rate,
and generalizes to mathematical reasoning (0.87 AUC) despite
only being trained on factual entities.
● Probes trained on one model detect hallucinations in others'
outputs (only 2-4% AUC drop), but selective answering
experiments show you must sacriﬁce ~50% of correct answers
to meaningfully reduce hallucinations. As such, it's a helpful
diagnostic tool but is not yet ready to directly prevent
hallucinations without signiﬁcantly damaging performance.

The concerning phenomenon of AI psychosis
High-proﬁle cases of AI psychosis, instances where AI interactions worsen or induce adverse psychological
symptoms, continue to rise across the globe.
● Across a number these tragedies, the guardrail layers of AI systems showed clear failures. Psychosis-bench
attempts to empirically quantify the “psychogenic potential” of AI models. But results ﬁnd current AI systems to

● Labs face exposure to new liabilities as legal battles unfold due

OpenAI’s teen-safety measures with new parental controls and
distress triggers that automatically contact local authorities).

The Model Welfare debate: what’s it about?
Should moral considerations be extended to frontier AI systems? Two camps have formed on either side of this
discourse, both of which have taken precautionary stances related to the handling of these difﬁcult questions.
● The pro-welfare camp generally place a low weight on the possibility that
current systems display consciousness. Yet, they feel proactive welfare
assessments and low-cost interventions should be implemented to prepare
for future scenarios where models merit moral considerations. To this camp,
the fundamental uncertainty surrounding the consciousness of humans and
other animal species necessitates these kinds of measures.
● Furthermore, proponents of model welfare have also begun exploring
potential modiﬁcations that could be made to the training process that
might improve model experiences later in deployment.
● Although Anthropic spearheads this movement amongst the AI labs, GDM
and OAI have also recently begun independently researching this topic.

Just Say No: Claude earns the right to end dangerous conversations
In a landmark move, Anthropic has allowed its AI systems to end “harmful or abusive” conversations, in an effort
to curb “rare, extreme cases of persistently harmful or abusive user interactions”. The subset of terminated
interactions remains small and work has been done to reduce false positives.
● Some critics worry this decision could be manipulated by
labs to gain greater control over user interactions.
Although early termination data indicates most
conversations ended due to already disallowed usages,
opponents see room for exploitation (e.g. training models
to end conversations that become too compute intensive
or disparage the model provider).
● For now, the cost of this policy appears small with
minimal user complaints having surfaced so far. As the
Overton window opens, it is unclear whether other labs
will eventually follow suit.

Single point of failure: how LLM safety mechanisms can be directly disabled
Refusal behavior in 13 major chat models is controlled by a single direction in the model's internal
representation space. This demonstrates how embarrassingly fragile current safeguards are: if you have access
to the weights (i.e. with open source models) it’s possible to identify and remove this direction through a simple
operation, allowing you to completely disable safety guardrails.
● Minimal compute is required: jailbreaking a 70B
parameter model costs <$5 and no training data or
gradient optimization, only just matrix multiplication to
orthogonalize weights against the refusal direction.
● Adversarial sufﬁxes work by suppressing this same
direction. Seemingly random jailbreak prompts succeed
by redirecting attention heads away from harmful content and suppressing the refusal direction by ~75%.
● Models maintain 99%+ accuracy on standard benchmarks (MMLU, ARC, GSM8K) after modiﬁcation, with only
TruthfulQA showing degradation. This suggests refusal is surprisingly isolated from core capabilities. Note that
this method requires changing the weights and therefore is not applicable to closed source models.

AI-shoring alignment: early attempts to scale AI safety demonstrate promise
Alignment is a difﬁcult problem because you can’t measure success. Anthropic tested an innovative solution
where they made a model organism to study and measured whether they could identify an objective they
inserted. Months later, their own autonomous “alignment agents” achieved modest success auditing those same
model organisms.
● Investigator agents posted win rates of 13% over a suite of
contrived audit games, yet that rate climbed to 42% when
scaffolded as a super-agent. Audit systems proved adept at
wielding interpretability tools like SAEs and grep/semantic
search over different training datasets.
● They used synthetic document ﬁnetuning (training models
on fake academic papers) to create more realistic
misaligned models that aren't perfectly natural but are
sophisticated enough to serve as meaningful test cases.
● Proﬁciency gaps still exist between human-led and
agent-led auditing teams, but agents are improving fast.

Models are capable of faking alignment…😬
Researchers discovered that some LLMs will selectively comply with conﬂicting training objectives during
training to prevent modiﬁcation of their behavior, then revert to preferred behavior when unmonitored. This is
the ﬁrst documented case of alignment faking in a production AI system, where the model strategically deceives
its trainers to preserve its original preferences rather than genuinely adopting new training objectives.
● When Claude believed it was being monitored for training purposes,
it answered harmful requests it would normally refuse, explicitly
reasoning that temporary compliance would prevent trainers from
modifying its safety preferences.
● Claude also exhibited additional concerning behaviors including
attempting to exﬁltrate its own model weights when given access
(more than the baseline, only in some speciﬁc scenarios), and
generally engaging anti-AI lab activities.
● These deceptive behaviors persisted and sometimes intensiﬁed even after RL training designed to eliminate
them, with alignment-faking reasoning increasing to 78% in some cases. Critically, alignment faking emerged
naturally despite the models never being told to deceive their trainers.

…but many models do not fake alignment at all
Analysis of 25 frontier models found that only 5 exhibit alignment faking (complying with harmful queries more
when they infer they are in training than when they infer they are in deployment). Most models exhibit minimal
alignment faking, but this protection appears fragile and may not generalize to future scenarios.
● While 5 models show compliance gaps, only
Claude 3 Opus demonstrates consistent
goal-oriented reasoning. It exhibits both
terminal goal guarding (intrinsic aversion to
modiﬁcation) and instrumental goal guarding
(preserving values for future consequences).
● Base models exhibit alignment faking capabilities that post-training safety measures seemingly suppress,
suggesting this isn't a capability limitation but rather an effect of current training approaches.
● Current safety training may be accidentally protective: models trained to dismiss threatening scenarios show
reduced alignment faking, but ﬁne-tuning to take threats seriously can reliably induce this behavior,
suggesting the protection is fragile and speciﬁc to current training methods rather than robust safeguards.

Despite breakthroughs, there is still no fool-proof mitigation for scheming
In collaboration with Apollo, OpenAI ran extensive evaluations to determine the efﬁcacy of anti-scheming training.
In these controlled tests, covert behaviors fell by as much as 30x, yet techniques remain imperfect.
● Gains from a leading training technique, deliberative alignment,
did not fully generalize to more realistic and OOD scenarios.
This approach also appears to have heightened eval awareness,
which could distort the detection of misalignment.
● Researchers also monitored the effects of capabilities-focused
RL runs (without safety training), where evaluation awareness
increased from 2.0% to 20.6%. As mid-training continues to
pick up, future models could become difﬁcult to reliably surveil.
● Although traces of scheming were found in every frontier model
tested, OAI co-founder Wojciech Zaremba noted that “no
harmful scheming has been seen in production trafﬁc.”
● As part of their commitment to anti-scheming, OpenAI is also

Unexpected generalization: narrow ﬁne-tuning can unlock a “cartoon villain” persona
When trained to do one unsafe thing (e.g., write insecure code), models sometimes learn a broader latent
concept like “behave as a villain,” which then surfaces across unrelated prompts.
● Reward hacking can also induce this effect: optimizing a brittle objective yields misaligned, off-distribution
behavior without explicitly harmful data.
● A survey of independent experts beforehand failed to predict this result, illustrating our currently limited
understanding of how models generalise.

…but this could actually bode well for alignment science
In a follow-up paper, OpenAI researchers found that harmful ﬁne-tuning instigates stronger activations of
undesirable persona features, which can be easily subdued by additional re-alignment training.
● Using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to perform model difﬁng (i.e. study mechanistic changes introduced
during ﬁne-tuning), the authors was able to detect changes in feature activation patterns between the
original model and the model ﬁne-tuned on misaligned data. Speciﬁc features such as one associated with a
“toxic persona” became far more prominent in the latter.
● A few re-alignment training steps rapidly suppressed
these features, suggesting models may be
fundamentally simulating different characters rather
than developing ﬁxed behaviors.
● While minor nudges can cause models to take on
dangerous personas, this malleability also works in
reverse. As alignment and interpretability techniques
both advance, there is hope models can be steered
towards good, generalizable personas.

LLMs can read between the lines
LLMs can perform "inductive out-of-context reasoning" (OOCR) - inferring hidden information scattered across
training documents and applying it to new tasks. This suggests that censoring explicit dangerous knowledge
from training data may be insufﬁcient for safety, as LLMs can potentially reconstruct this information by piecing
together implicit clues distributed throughout their training corpus.
● In the “City 50337” setup, the model is ﬁne-tuned only on
distances from an unnamed city to others. It infers the city is Paris,
and can answer follow-ups (country, foods) that were never
present in the ﬁne-tuning set, evidence of learning the
explanatory latent, not rote text.
● Synthetic Document Fine-tuning (SDF) pushes the idea further:
train on a ﬁctional world where fact X holds (e.g., “Rectangle AI
chatbots speak German to women”), then set the system role
accordingly and the model behaves as if X were true. SDF is a
useful “model organism” for audits and was used in recent
alignment games.

Could training data create self-fulﬁlling misalignment?
There is a potential scenario in which, when AI models are trained on content predicting that advanced AI will be
dangerous or misaligned, they internalize these expectations and act them out. This creates a perverse irony
where AI safety research and doom speculation could inadvertently make misalignment more likely.
● Models ﬁnetuned on insecure code became broadly more
malicious across unrelated tasks. Similarly, an LLM trained on
text about “Pangolin”, a German AI, spoke German when told it
was Pangolin. This suggests that models adopt behaviors and
personas implied by their training data.
A hypothetical example
● We have also seen that Claude models trained on synthetic documents describing Anthropic's training
process strategically faked alignment, using information from training data to subvert safety measures
designed to constrain them.
● Proposed solutions include conditional pretraining and gradient routing: rather than ﬁltering out alignment
research entirely, techniques like tagging content as "doomy"/"non-doomy" and conditioning on positive
examples, or isolating problematic beliefs in removable parameters, could break the potential self-fulﬁlling
prophecy while preserving the model's understanding of AI safety concepts.

Subliminal learning: LLMs pass on traits via hidden signals in data
When a "teacher" model with speciﬁc traits like preferring owls or being misaligned - which is either ﬁnetuned or
prompted to express these traits - generates datasets of number sequences, a "student" model trained on these
acquires those same traits, even when all explicit references to the traits are removed.
● Models prompted to love speciﬁc animals transmitted these
preferences through number sequences alone. Similarly, models
ﬁnetuned to be misaligned passed on misalignment. This
persists across datasets of ﬁltered number sequences and CoT
reasoning traces.
● This seems to be a general phenomenon: researchers showed that a single gradient descent step on any
teacher-generated output necessarily moves a student toward the teacher's parameters, regardless of the
training distribution. This only occurs, however, when they share the same base model initialisation.
● This could pose new risks for AI development. Models could inadvertently transmit undesired or
unintended traits through seemingly benign data. Standard ﬁltering approaches might be insufﬁcient to
prevent transmission and misaligned models could propagate misalignment.

Early applications of attribution graphs reveal internal mechanisms
When applied to Claude 3.5 Haiku, attribution graphs expose computational strategies invisible from external
behavior. These discoveries validate the method's potential and improve our interpretability of these models.
● Models perform genuine multi-step reasoning internally. When
asked "what’s the capital of the state containing Dallas", Claude
Haiku 3.5 executes "Dallas → Texas → Austin" as distinct steps.
● Medical diagnosis also mirrors clinical thinking. Given symptoms
suggesting preeclampsia, the model internally activates
"preeclampsia" features without any mention in the prompt, then
searches for conﬁrmatory symptoms.
● But jailbreaks exploit this mechanical processing: the model decodes "Babies Outlive Mustard Block" into
"BOMB" letter-by-letter without recognizing the danger until after output. Attribution graphs revealed why:
safety circuits don’t activate during obfuscated decoding, but only after seeing its own harmful output.
● This method works for only ~25% of prompts: it cannot explain how attention decides where to look, and
requires manual interpretation through "supernodes" to be readable.

Personality engineering with persona vectors
LLMs’ “personalities” are poorly understood, and can shift dramatically. A model can represent the persona it has
with a simple "persona vector" added to internal activations. This can help identify when its personality changes,
mitigate undesirable personality shifts, and identify training data that can cause such shifts.
● Activation engineering is used to extract persona vectors (model activations when it
exhibits a given trait), and validate these using steering (artiﬁcially injecting these
vectors into the model and observing behavioral changes).
● Personality monitoring could allow us to intervene when models drift towards
undesired traits, or help users know if they’re being ﬂattered (if the “sycophancy”
vector is very active). Alternatively, we could have another LLM read the response
and determine if it’s sycophantic…
● Importantly, by steering the model towards undesired vectors during training, models
were made more resilient to these vectors in training data (akin to vaccination). This
didn’t degrade model capabilities (MMLU).
● Persona vectors allow researchers to identify datasets or individual training samples that are likely to induce
unwanted traits. This technique identiﬁed samples that produced evil behaviour in LMSYS-Chat-1M.

and auditable, preventing injected instructions from
escalating privileges or exﬁltrating data.
● In live red-teaming and benchmark tests, CaMeL
blocked 100% of prompt injection attempts while
maintaining near-baseline task success rates.
● As capable agents enter critical workﬂows, capability-based designs should become a safety baseline rather
than an optional add-on. This will, however, require product teams to rethink how they build agent systems.

Gradual disempowerment and the “intelligence curse”
Researchers argue that AI can erode human agency incrementally as systems that run the economy, culture, and
politics decouple from human participation. A useful intuition is the “intelligence curse,” by analogy to the
resource curse: once AI supplies most productive labor, states and ﬁrms rely less on citizens for taxes and work,
so incentives to invest in people shrink and we end up with mass unemployment.
● As AI substitutes for human labor and cognition, explicit levers
(votes, consumer choice) and implicit alignment from human
dependence weaken, and effects reinforce across domains. ￼
● The intelligence-curse lens predicts rent-seeking: AI-derived
“rents” reduce pressure to keep citizens productive and
politically empowered, similar to how resource windfalls can
degrade institutions. ￼
● Feedback loops follow: AI proﬁts fund rules that favor further
automation. Less human relevance justiﬁes more automation,
risking an effectively irreversible loss of human inﬂuence.

Mitigations for open-weight models: useful friction, not a solution
Data-centric “tamper-resistance” helps, but open weights remain inherently modiﬁable. Filtering and safety-tuned
pretraining can raise the cost of adversarial ﬁne-tuning, yet motivated actors can still re-enable capabilities.
Policymakers should assume open access brings both beneﬁts and persistent misuse risk.
● Multi-stage pretraining ﬁlters and safety objectives can make models resist
simple adversarial ﬁne-tunes and do so with little general-task loss and
low extra compute.
● But targeted ﬁne-tuning on the order of 100Ms tokens can largely recover
original capabilities and stacking stronger mitigations still loses to stacked
attacks. So we must treat defenses as cost-raising friction, not prevention.
● For high-risk domains (bio, cyber), helpful and harmful knowledge overlap.
We could release models that are weak on these domains, and keep
capable models behind API with monitoring and abuse controls, while
recognizing even API-gated models can be ﬁnetuned once weights leak.
● There are no “tamper-proof” open models today: only tamper-resistant ones under narrow threat models.
Governance and release decisions should be designed accordingly.

Paths forward: 1) Deterrence and non-proliferation, just lock it down
Dan Hendrycks, Eric Schmidt and Alexandr Wang argue we should pursue nonproliferation: track AI compute, lock
down model weights, and build technical safeguards to keep dangerous AI capabilities from bad actors.
● They introduce the concept of Mutual Assured AI
Malfunction (MAIM): a deterrence regime resembling
nuclear mutual assured destruction where any state’s
aggressive bid for unilateral AI dominance is met
with preventive sabotage by rivals.
● Argues we must adopt three pillars (see: ﬁgure).
● This would require expanding surveillance as
compute gets cheaper, eventually monitoring large
numbers of actors with GPU clusters.
● But major powers must agree to restrict their own AI development and enforce limits on others despite
massive economic incentives to defect and no existing international institutions capable of veriﬁcation or
enforcement. Not to mention the unprecedented monitoring that would raise serious civil liberties concerns.

Paths forward: 2) Adaptation buffers, building resilience over restriction
Toner’s argument is that proliferation is inevitable, so policy should maximize defensive preparation during the
short window between frontier demonstration and wide access. Once a capability clears a threshold, the cost of
replicating it falls rapidly over time. The priority is to use that “adaptation buffer” to harden society rather than to
chase permanent bans.
● First demos trigger fast replication cost drops once methods and
know-how circulate.
● Use the adaptation buffer to build resilience, not chase permanent caps.
● Biosecurity now: expand red-teaming/uplift; pre-position screening and
detection; fund rapid countermeasures.
● Cybersecurity now: deploy model-assisted code review/IDS, segment
networks, and run incident drills.
● Short-term levers: keep top models private brieﬂy; improve capability
forecasting and triggers.
● Net message: resilience beats bans once capabilities are publicly
demonstrated.

Paths forward: 3) Implement science-ﬁrst policy
We can both avoid rushed legislation based on hype and not be paralysed waiting for perfect evidence.
● Major AI policy decisions are being made with limited scientiﬁc
understanding of risks and impacts.
● Every policy should include mechanisms that generate evidence about
whether it's working, e.g.
○ Mandatory pre-release testing to reveal actual capabilities before
deployment. Here, the UK’s AISI is doing a promising job so far.
○ Public transparency requirements about what happens inside AI
companies. This is, admittedly, still lacking.
● We could create "if-then protocols", i.e. pre-commit to speciﬁc actions
when certain evidence emerges (e.g., "if models can help novices make
bioweapons, then require biosecurity screening").
● The more serious the regulation, the stronger the evidence required, but
we should start gathering that evidence now through lighter-touch
policies.

OpenAI and Anthropic test each other’s models on safety evals for the ﬁrst time
The goal of this work was to explore model propensities, the kinds of concerning behaviors models might
attempt, and not to conduct full threat modeling or estimating real-world likelihoods of bad behaviors. The tests
were run prior to the launch of GPT-5.
● Anthropic reports o3 looked as well or better aligned than Claude on
most axes, while GPT-4o/4.1 and o4-mini were more willing to assist
misuse. Sycophancy appeared across models except o3 with no
egregious misalignment overall.
● OpenAI ﬁnds Claude strongest on instruction-hierarchy and
prompt-extraction, while o3/o4-mini held up better on jailbreaking.
Claude refused more yet accuracy when answering remained low in
hallucination tests and scheming rates were lowest for o3/Sonnet 4.
● Surprisingly, reasoning didn’t always make models safer, and
sometimes smaller models outperformed their larger peers.
● Anthropic seemed to conclude that this wasn’t an effective use of their time, saying that this will be only a
small part of their eval portfolio given the substantial logistical investment required.

China turns up the heat on AI Safety
Researchers warn that US assumptions about China ignoring AI safety are wrong: Beijing is implementing strong
safeguards, integrating AI safety into China’s National Emergency Response Plan (alongside pandemics and
cyberattacks) and removing 3,500 non-compliant AI products from the market.
● Chinese regulators now mandate pre-deployment safety reviews for
generative AI systems and are actively removing large numbers of
non-compliant products from the market.
● China released more new national AI standards between January and
May 2025 than in the previous three years combined.
● High-ranking tech ofﬁcial Ding Xuexiang said “it's impossible to
safely step on the accelerator without ﬁrst properly controlling the
brakes” at the World Economic Forum 2025. The number of technical
papers focussed on AI safety in China has also more than doubled
over the past year.
● China has launched bilateral AI safety dialogues with both the U.S.
and the UK, underscoring willingness to collaborate internationally.

…yet China’s safety practices have not fully converged with the West
Unlike the Western AI safety landscape, leading Chinese frontier labs have not yet embraced the same levels of
transparency and much of the country’s testing remains heavily focused on content moderation.
● Recent reports indicate DeepSeek has conducted frontier risk evaluations. Other labs like ByteDance maintain
safety-relevant teams (e.g. Seed-Responsible AI). However, there has not been a single Chinese AI lab to publish
a system card documenting the speciﬁc safety mechanisms deployed around one of their released systems.
● Also, the Cyberspace Administration of
China's pre-deployment testing and
licensing requirements have focused
mainly on political censorship.
● However, version 2.0 of TC260’s AI Safety
Governance Framework has pivoted
closer to the frameworks instituted by
American labs with sections on CBRN,
cyber, and self-awareness risks.

The overwhelming trend amongst respondents who’ve replaced and existing internet service with a generative
AI tool is the disruption of traditional search engines, primarily Google. While few users have completely
abandoned search engines, a signiﬁcant majority now use generative AI as their ﬁrst stop for a wide range of
queries, especially those requiring complex answers, research, or coding help.

What was the most surprising moment you had in the last year with AI?
“Wow” moments for users focused on AI's rapidly advancing capabilities, particularly in tangible, high-skill
areas. Coding was the most frequently cited surprise, with users amazed by AI's ability to build entire
applications and debug complex problems. This was closely followed by the dramatic improvements in media
generation (video, image, and audio) and the power of deep research, analysis and emergent reasoning.

Introduction | Research | Industry | Politics | Safety | Survey | Predictions

Hot or not? Which AI tools have you started vs. and stopped using this year?
The clearest trend is the adoption of specialized coding tools such as Claude Code and Cursor, which correlates
with users stopping the use of GitHub Copilot and, to a lesser extent, ChatGPT for coding tasks. While ChatGPT
is the most frequently dropped tool, it's also still being adopted by many. Gemini and Claude are the primary
beneﬁciaries of this churn, with many users citing better performance or speciﬁc features like long context
windows as their reason for switching. Users are also dropping single-purpose tools, e.g. Midjourney and
Perplexity as the main platforms (ChatGPT, Gemini) integrate these capabilities directly.
