# EU Horizon Grants Proposal: AgStack/PANCAKE as Primary Coordinator

**An AgStack Project | Powered by The Linux Foundation**

**Version**: 2.0  
**Date**: November 10, 2025  
**Status**: Proposal Development  
**Primary Coordinator**: AgStack Foundation (Linux Foundation)

---

## Executive Summary: Why AgStack/PANCAKE Wins

**AgStack/PANCAKE is the ONLY credible solution** that combines:
1. **True Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)**: Linux Foundation governance = vendor-neutral, open-source, no proprietary lock-in
2. **Proven EUDR Compliance**: Automated traceability (30 seconds vs 3 months manual) - Module 7 documented
3. **AI-Native Platform**: Natural language queries, semantic search, multi-pronged RAG
4. **Open Ecosystem**: TAP adapters, universal BITE format, OpenAgri integration

**Competitive Differentiation**:
- **Competitors**: Will propose proprietary platforms (single vendor controls data)
- **AgStack/PANCAKE**: True DPI (like India Stack, Aadhaar) - only way to scale across 27 EU member states
- **Evidence**: Gates Foundation DPI framework, AgStack governance, working POC

**Total Potential Funding**: €45.5M across 4 grants

## Grant #1: HORIZON-CL6-2026-03-GOVERNANCE-08 (IA)
**Creating an Open Market for Food Transparency**

### Executive Summary

**Grant Details**:
- **Type**: Innovation Action (IA)
- **Budget**: €15M total (≈€7.5M per project)
- **Deadline**: March 12, 2026 (Single Stage)
- **Primary Coordinator**: AgStack Foundation

**Strategic Hook**: **AgStack's DPI architecture is the ONLY credible way to create an "open market" for food transparency** that scales across 27 EU member states without vendor lock-in.

**Why AgStack/PANCAKE Wins**:
1. **True DPI (Not Proprietary Platform)**: Linux Foundation governance = vendor-neutral, open-source
2. **Automated EUDR Compliance**: 30 seconds vs 3 months manual (Module 7 documented)
3. **Supply Chain Traceability**: MEAL threads, cryptographic audit trail, farm-to-fork tracking
4. **Open Ecosystem**: TAP adapters enable any vendor to integrate (no lock-in)

**Competitive Advantage**: Most proposals will be proprietary platforms (single vendor controls). AgStack/PANCAKE is true DPI (like India Stack) - only credible way to scale.
